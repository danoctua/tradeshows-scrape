The environmental impact of single-use plastics is well documented as one of the most vexing issues we face. There are over 8 billion plastic hangers discarded every year. Our new hanger represents a step in closing the circular economy."

Susan, Cabell, and Erika’s dream was to help a host “set the table” for an evening with friends or family, where the company and memories are savored, and the place settings are beautifully stress free. They created Relish; a line of tableware molded from their handcrafted pottery but made from melamine. This allows for a table setting to be sophisticated and unique while practical for everyday use without the fear of chipping or breaking. People just won't believe that it's plastic -until they drop it! Relish is just as comfortable next to linen and silver as it is beside paper towels and takeout. That’s why they call it “Today’s Everyday”."
