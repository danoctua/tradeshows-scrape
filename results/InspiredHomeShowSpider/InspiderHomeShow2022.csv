International Housewares Association (IHA),01/03/2022,2022,https://www.housewares.org/,DM,Relish,,,,,,,,,,,,"Relish is the creation of three dear friends who share a love for back porch dinners and relaxed entertaining. Susan, Cabell, and Erika’s dream was to help a host “set the table” for an evening with friends or family, where the company and memories are savored, and the place settings are beautifully stress free. They created Relish; a line of tableware molded from their handcrafted pottery but made from melamine. This allows for a table setting to be sophisticated and unique while practical for everyday use without the fear of chipping or breaking. People just won't believe that it's plastic -until they drop it! Relish is just as comfortable next to linen and silver as it is beside paper towels and takeout. That’s why they call it “Today’s Everyday”."

Once I realized my daughters inherited my insect attraction and tried every other remedy on the market, I discovered a little-known suction tool that removes irritants before the body causes a reaction. The product was a game-changer for my family, so my mother and I partnered to brand the Bug Bite Thing and bring it to the U.S. to ease the effects of bites and stings for others. Within a few years, it became the #1 selling product for insect relief on Amazon and is one of the top sellers within the Health & Household category. In 2019, we began selling in CVS Pharmacy and landed a deal with investor Lori Greiner on ABC’s Shark Tank. We expanded to serve Canada and South Korea, with more countries in the works. The credibility of Bug Bite Thing has strengthened because it truly helps people. We look forward to working with other partnering businesses who share our mission to bring relief to more families"
