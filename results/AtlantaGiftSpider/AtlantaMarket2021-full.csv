Medeiros Way,United States,"Fashion Accessories/Jewelry | Fine Jewelry | Prom, Social Occasion | Religious Gifts",,,"John Medeiros is a local artist in the jewelry industry. After coming to America at the age of nine, Mr. Medeiros entered the manufacturing world working with precious metals after school. As his expertise grew, he established Tahoe Jewelry in 1985, providing the precious metals jewelry industry and prominent designers with intricate polishing and stone setting services. Influenced by the skilled and talented artisans of the Renaissance, Mr. Medeiros had a vision to produce beautiful, high quality products that are both affordable and timeless, which lead to the launch of The John Medeiros Jewelry Collection in 2000. The John Medeiros Jewelry Collection is produced from concept to completion, on site in East Providence, RI. With hand carved detailing, Mr. Medeiros implements the same craftsmanship and engineering techniques used in the high end, precious metals jewelry industry. By utilizing rhodium and 14Kt gold overlay and accenting with cubic zirconium, his vision of providing consumers with high quality, affordable jewelry has become the mission of the company. The original design of The John Medeiros Jewelry Collection has been widely accepted and celebrated since its release and can also be found in qualified, independent retail stores nationwide. The company’s success is based under the founding belief that high quality, handmade, intricate and long lasting jewelry should be accessible and enjoyed by all.Each piece is made from:Base Material: Non-precious lead-free premium alloy with .05% of silver which are strong and lightweight.Overlay/Finish/ Electronic Plate: Rhodium and 14Kt gold which has a permanent non-tarnish, easy to care for finish. Rhodium, a derivative of platinum, has all the attributes of platinum with the added benefit of being harder, lasting longer, and a whiter tone.Stones: Our product stones are Cubic Zirconium."

Covenant began its journey 30 years ago, in the basement of its owners, Pat and Roger Schroeder, and has grown to become one of the leading suppliers of fashion rings in the country.  What began with dreams of wildly successful sales and profits, quickly turned into the hard reality of survival.  Not only did Covenant survive, it thrived.  Today, our customers benefit from those many years of struggle.When you sell only one product as Covenant did for 30 years, you learn quickly that your customer must be successful or you'll soon be out of business.  So Pat and Roger began thinking about their customers' success rather than their own, believing that the one would balance the other.  Everything Covenant does is built around their customer's need to make money from selling their product.  Free displays, free stock cabinets, great margins and liberal exchange privileges are just the beginning.R.S. Covenant sells a program.  They will be the first to tell you that there are many companies who can sell you a ring, but few, if any, that can sell you a program that works!  And work it does!  Many customers find Covenant's program to be the single best seller in their store, producing more sales and profit per square foot than any other item.  Even better, Covenant has developed a way to prove it.  As part of their customer service policy, Covenant tracks every re-order that a customer places.  Armed with this information, we are capable of producing a performance analysis and income statement for any customer's display at the click of a button.Covenant sells rings that are made of Sterling Silver and rings that are made of Jeweler's Bronze (a brass alloy).  They all have the look of fine jewelry.  Rings are not a trendy item and Roger admits that some styles have been in their line for 30 years.  Some styles just refuse to go away and"

At that time, I was making Christmas ornaments to hang on our family Christmas tree. Now, twenty-two years later they are sold in stores nationwide. We also had the privelge of creating a specially designed ornament for The White House Christmas tree in 2008. Each ornament is still entirely hand-made and individually packaged right here in Kannapolis- our small town in North Carolina. 
In 2012 we celebrated our twentieth anniversary and added the Crystal Collection. The ornaments in the Crystal Collection have hand applied swarovski crystals. Since 2013 we have added over 50 new designs to the Crystal Collection. We also do custom designs for many of our customers including Kennedy Space Center, NASA, and SAK's Fifth Avenue to name a few.
My prayer will always be that Heart Gifts ornament reflects the real meaning of Christmas and the love of family and friend. Showroom: Bldg. #1- 20-D2"

All bags are unique and designed in CANADA!All preneLOVE bags are crafted with premium neoprene (not the flimsy stuff!), a material at the perfect intersection of durability and lightweight.  Special touches like sailing rope handles with reinforced metal grommets, magnetic closures, and fully-lined interiors are each individually chosen because they have the look, feel, and thoughtfulness of high-quality finishing you can rely on for both function and fashion.Besides knowing your bag can stand up to real life, we love that our bags are also a great way to show off your very own personal style.  Whether it's a pop of bright color on a belt bag, or a beautifully balanced neutral tote that will go with everything in your closet, we're always introducing new designs and patterns to make sure you can find that one bag that's totally ""you"".  Or, the two bags... or the three... ;)Love isn't just in our name, it's in everything we do.  From designing each bag ourselves, to hand selecting our finishes, to taking pride in our top-notch customer service, we want every moment you spend with preneLOVE and our products to be one you love, too.  It's also the reason behind many preneLOVE initiatives, like our support of Plan Canada's Because I am a Girl program.  Afterall, the world can always use a little more LOVE... xo"

Growing up in Ireland with a family of artisans, attention to detail and aesthetics were part of his everyday experience. At age 16, Simon began his craft as an apprentice at his father’s pottery studio. From there, he went on to work with notable glassmakers all over Europe before opening his namesake studio. Inspired by centuries-old Georgian glassmaking techniques and using the finest natural materials, Simon set out to create designs that bring pleasure and inspiration with every use, every day.In the age of bigger, better, faster, we believe simplicity, quality, and artisanship are tenets of a better way of life. From our hand-thrown pottery to our lead-free glassware made with custom molds and purpose-built furnaces, each handcrafted piece carries a story that lends meaning, authenticity, and grace to every use.  From our heritage of craftsmanship to design that’s meant to last for generations, everything we do is in service of creating a table to gather with the people we love. These moments of togetherness are what inspire us.

Back in 2012 our daughter Savannah (a then persistent 11-year old) insisted we create an online store for her to sell her homemade lip balms and sugars scrubs that would help pay for her traveling soccer fees. It was a 'cute' idea we thought . . . little did we know what was about to happen.

Before we knew it, we were traveling to tradeshows nationwide selling our high-end beauty line to resorts, boutiques, grocery chains, gift shops, hospitals, casinos, florists and online retailers. 

Retailers consistently tell us our all-natural shower steamers are one of their top-selling items! In addition, we added a new men's line (Made Man Shower and Shave), and it has taken off like crazy.

We make all our products in our beautiful little town of Wenatchee, WA.

She graduated from Kansas State University with a degree in art education and has a passion for art, antiques and product design. Her love of antiques began by unearthing treasures at garage sales with her father and attending auctions as a teenager. After a few years of collecting, her home was bursting at the seams and she knew if she wanted to continue to buy she needed to have an outlet to sell. She began selling at antique shows, opened her home for seasonal open houses and in l987 opened a retail store in Topeka, Kansas. Kristen brought her husband, Bob, onboard in l994 and together they have six children, Callie the cat and an adorable cocker-mutt named Bentley. Kristen began designing home decor in 2008 because she saw a need in the home decor industry for stylish, yet affordable, products. Her designs are inspired by the wonderful homes, gardens and antique shops she sees on her antique hunting excursions in Europe. She is especially intrigued by the country of Belgium and the Belgian style of decorating: similar to French only pared down, rustic yet refined, repurposed, bare woods, and the most beautiful things aren't always the finest. All pieces in the White x White collection are hand-made and have a wonderful vintage appearance with finishes that vary slightly from piece to piece. It's our belief that these slight variations add character and charm to the products and should in no way be considered defects. We hope you are as excited as we are about our line and we truly appreciate your business."

The founders, Tim and Beth Merck, a couple who shared a special love for Christmas, are credited with revitalizing the art of mouth-blown fine glass ornaments as a result of their reintroducing figural designs to the United States in 1979. Today, Old World Christmas offers the most extensive and best-loved collection with over 1,400 proprietary designs in styles ranging from traditional to whimsical. Our vast selection of finely crafted and affordable ornaments offers many choices to fit your personality or style. In addition we offer vintage style night lights. Old World Christmas Creations Each figural glass ornament produced by Old World Christmas is hand crafted in age-old tradition using the same techniques that originated in the 1800's. Molten glass is mouth-blown into finely carved molds made exclusively for Old World Christmas, before a hot solution of liquid silver is poured inside. The ornaments are then hand-painted and glittered in a series of labor-intensive steps to achieve the beautiful creations. Our Commitment At Old World Christmas our goal is simple: to offer the best in quality, design, and value. We promise to provide high-quality, traditionally designed, hand-crafted ornaments that are created with even more attention to detail than those produced 100 years ago. We are committed to excellent customer service, affordable prices, and fast, efficient shipping that is second-to-none.Old World Christmas is the premier brand of Christmas ornaments in the country."

Bedrock Tree Farm fir needle products were developed in 2012 because of our desire to find a use for the endless fir needle branches that are sheared to the ground and left to turn to mulch. We felt such incredibly healthy, succulent needles must be recycled and used for our benefit and enjoyment year round.  BINGO! Soaps, Candles, Salt Scrub and more. In doing research we found that the oils in fir needles have anti-microbial (kills bacteria, fungi), anti-septic (reduces possibility of infection), and anti-catarrhal (reduces inflammation of mucous membranes) properties.  Fir needles are known for their disinfecting properties.  Also known for aiding respiratory problems like bronchitis.  Analgesic properties make it useful in rubs for sore muscles or arthritis.  Many of our customers would say that their Christmas tree loses that fresh cut smell after a week or so.  Tom recommended lighting a fir needle candle.  However, in our search for an authentic smelling (a scent like Tom after shearing trees all afternoon) we found it didn't exist.  So, what to do?  Put the tree in a jar.  We literally harvest branches sheared, clip off the needles, dry and grind them into a powder and that is what is in every product we make...candles, soaps, scrub, body care.  It is what sets us apart from all of the other flavor of the month candles.  It is a unique scent that you have to smell to believe.  Of course, knowing we would be eating, sleeping, and breathing these products every day to make them, we have made every attempt to ensure our health is at the lowest risk possible.  We use pure Essential oils and naturally derived fragrance oils and soy wax is 100% non-gmo.  We offer several different containers and wick types with 9 different combinations of scents that all contain the fir needle base."

Just as we can only reach our potential when faced with the fire of life’s trials and tribulations, fused glass must be fired in the kiln to become what it never could be without it. The real beauty and potential of the glass is only revealed through the fire! Sometimes the glass doesn’t come out of the kiln the way we expect, but just as life does not always go the way we expect or end with our mistakes… glass can always be reworked… and sometimes those unexpected outcomes can turn into the impetus for inspiration and creation of artwork more beautiful than originally conceived! My goal is to create fused glass art and artisan pieces designed to be treasured by families for generations.”"

But Chris and Greg Robitaille were looking for more. They wanted to form partnerships with organizations dedicated to the conservation and preservation of our public lands and give back to the places they love. The brothers regularly donate a percentage of map sales to ongoing efforts to protect these lands. The result is a rewarding partnership combining original artwork, unique story-telling and philanthropy. These entirely custom and original maps are truly one-of-a-kind keepsakes to share with friends and family for years to come. There are simply no other maps that can compare anywhere!"

Peters discovered the blacksmith who had fashioned the crosses, soon to be renowned Haitian artist Georges Liautaud … and so began Haitian metal art. The original raw material was iron, but with many goods shipped to Haiti in 55-gallon steel oil drums, there was a ready supply of discarded drums for the artisans. Over the years the number of Haitian metal artists has multiplied via families and mentor / students embracing the craft. The center of Haitian metal arts is the village of Croix-des-Bouquets, where the clang-clang of metal on metal, the hammers banging out the sculptures, is a constant music. The artisans start with designs inspired by nature and culture. From cardboard patterns, they trace their design with chalk on the flattened metal from torn-down oil drums. With chisels and hammers, by hand they carefully cut and decorate the metal. Each piece is shaped and smoothed, then the artists boldly and proudly chisel their name on to the metal sculpture. Beyond Borders has been working with and nurturing Haitian metal artists in Croix-des-Bouquets for fifteen years. We meet directly with them to ensure that quality and craftsmanship standards remain high. We love the constant exchange and blossoming of new product and design ideas. Most importantly, we see real economic improvement and lives bettered through the creation and sharing of their beautiful art. This success is about a true partnership between the Haitian artists, Beyond Borders, and You!"

So far, we agree that the world is watery. While we wait for our big breakthrough, we'll continue to pursue one of our earlier discoveries: people seem to really like intellectual giants reduced to little finger puppets and mugs, and subject to witty jokes. At the Unemployed Philosophers Guild, we like to kill two birds with one stone.* We make people laugh and earn enough money to sit around reading Spinoza and raising our families.Yes, we think deeply about the things we do and the objects we bring into this world. Our CEP (Chief Executive Philosopher) personally tested the Kierkegaard finger puppet while reading Hegel's ""Geisteswissenschaften"" to determine Kierkegaard did not know shit about Hegel. Our staff conducted temporal thought experiments while wearing UPG Einstein Relativity Watches. Subsequent to eating a Will to Power Bar, an Associate Philosopher had the energy to declare ""God is dead"" and be on time for schul. Suffice it to say we're proud to return philosophy to the days of Thales, when a philosopher could brandish a few crackpot ideas, make a living, and make the world a better place. Part of every purchase you make goes to philosophically profound causes, such as lunch and gold plated faucets in the Ivory Tower bathrooms.
