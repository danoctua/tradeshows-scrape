In 2003, Allure introduced the Allure Construction. This patented built-in corset provides the signature fit and structure you can only find with Allure.  With a perfectly constructed gown made with luxurious fabrics in a modern silhouette, every Allure bride walks down the aisle in confident style."

Raven's Nest was founded in 1980 by our matriarch, Raven, and for the past twelve years her legacy has been carried on by her oldest daughter, Monica.  For 40 years we've been creating and sharing unique, handmade gifts and artisan jams + spices.  Every item in our collection is rooted in Raven’s artistry, love of good food, creativity, and ability to innovate and adapt in both times of plenty and times of want.

Our ""sweet with a little heat"" jams are a modern twist on a time-honored, southern favorite.  Thoughtfully sourced fruits are blended with a medley of peppers to create a perfect marriage of sweet and spicy. Known for their versatile uses, from cocktails, to cheese pairings, to marinades and glazes for grilling, our jams are simply too good for just biscuits! 

Since 1990, our award-winning Mulling Spices have been an integral part of holiday traditions in homes across the United States. A delicious and aromatic blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, orange and lemon, every sip tastes like a memory.  Traditionally used for creating hot spiced cider or mulled wine, our spices can also be incorporated into baked goods and seasonal cocktails. Versatile and flavorful, Raven's Nest Mulling Spices are a staple of the modern, southern pantry. 

Raven’s Nest products are made in small batches with clean ingredients and are gluten and preservative free."

She graduated from Kansas State University with a degree in art education and has a passion for art, antiques and product design. Her love of antiques began by unearthing treasures at garage sales with her father and attending auctions as a teenager. After a few years of collecting, her home was bursting at the seams and she knew if she wanted to continue to buy she needed to have an outlet to sell. She began selling at antique shows, opened her home for seasonal open houses and in l987 opened a retail store in Topeka, Kansas. Kristen brought her husband, Bob, onboard in l994 and together they have six children, Callie the cat and an adorable cocker-mutt named Bentley. Kristen began designing home decor in 2008 because she saw a need in the home decor industry for stylish, yet affordable, products. Her designs are inspired by the wonderful homes, gardens and antique shops she sees on her antique hunting excursions in Europe. She is especially intrigued by the country of Belgium and the Belgian style of decorating: similar to French only pared down, rustic yet refined, repurposed, bare woods, and the most beautiful things aren't always the finest. All pieces in the White x White collection are hand-made and have a wonderful vintage appearance with finishes that vary slightly from piece to piece. It's our belief that these slight variations add character and charm to the products and should in no way be considered defects. We hope you are as excited as we are about our line and we truly appreciate your business."

Each ornament is still entirely hand-made and individually packaged right here in Kannapolis- our small town in North Carolina. 
In 2012 we celebrated our twentieth anniversary and added the Crystal Collection. The ornaments in the Crystal Collection have hand applied swarovski crystals. Since 2013 we have added over 50 new designs to the Crystal Collection. We also do custom designs for many of our customers including Kennedy Space Center, NASA, and SAK's Fifth Avenue to name a few.

In 2006 Stephen and Elke's oldest daughter, Sophie, joined the company and is now the sales and marketing manager. Stephen continues to be involved in the company, overseeing all new product development,training of new staff, and when he has time, working on his own art projects and commissions.In 1999, the company suffered the loss of Elke Kitras to Leukemia, but the vision that she and Stephen developed for the company continues to thrive.

The founders, Tim and Beth Merck, a couple who shared a special love for Christmas, are credited with revitalizing the art of mouth-blown fine glass ornaments as a result of their reintroducing figural designs to the United States in 1979. Today, Old World Christmas offers the most extensive and best-loved collection with over 1,400 proprietary designs in styles ranging from traditional to whimsical. Our vast selection of finely crafted and affordable ornaments offers many choices to fit your personality or style. In addition we offer vintage style night lights. Old World Christmas Creations Each figural glass ornament produced by Old World Christmas is hand crafted in age-old tradition using the same techniques that originated in the 1800's. Molten glass is mouth-blown into finely carved molds made exclusively for Old World Christmas, before a hot solution of liquid silver is poured inside. The ornaments are then hand-painted and glittered in a series of labor-intensive steps to achieve the beautiful creations. Our Commitment At Old World Christmas our goal is simple: to offer the best in quality, design, and value. We promise to provide high-quality, traditionally designed, hand-crafted ornaments that are created with even more attention to detail than those produced 100 years ago.

Free displays, free stock cabinets, great margins and liberal exchange privileges are just the beginning.R.S. Covenant sells a program.  They will be the first to tell you that there are many companies who can sell you a ring, but few, if any, that can sell you a program that works!  And work it does!  Many customers find Covenant's program to be the single best seller in their store, producing more sales and profit per square foot than any other item.  Even better, Covenant has developed a way to prove it.  As part of their customer service policy, Covenant tracks every re-order that a customer places.  Armed with this information, we are capable of producing a performance analysis and income statement for any customer's display at the click of a button.Covenant sells rings that are made of Sterling Silver and rings that are made of Jeweler's Bronze (a brass alloy).

Sustainably harvested from the dry-tropical forests of Eastern Bolivia, Ipe timber exhibits a deep chocolate-brown grain when new that may be allowed to naturally age to an elegant silver patina or brought back to an ‘as new’ finish at any time. With proper care and maintenance, the strength, color and beauty of Ipe wood can be enjoyed for a lifetime."

The John Medeiros Jewelry Collection is produced from concept to completion, on site in East Providence, RI. With hand carved detailing, Mr. Medeiros implements the same craftsmanship and engineering techniques used in the high end, precious metals jewelry industry.

The original design of The John Medeiros Jewelry Collection has been widely accepted and celebrated since its release and can also be found in qualified, independent retail stores nationwide. The company’s success is based under the founding belief that high quality, handmade, intricate and long lasting jewelry should be accessible and enjoyed by all.Each piece is made from:Base Material: Non-precious lead-free premium alloy with .05% of silver which are strong and lightweight.Overlay/Finish/ Electronic Plate: Rhodium and 14Kt gold which has a permanent non-tarnish, easy to care for finish.

Prior to the olive orchard, the Hobdy family farm was used for hay production and family recreation. OLIVE ORCHARDS OF GEORGIA is located in South Georgia, a short distance from the Georgia/Florida line. The idea of growing olives came after a summer vacation to California which included tours of several olive orchards. The seed was planted in the minds of the Hobdy family. The clearing of the land began in summer of 2013 and fields were then prepared for planting the first crop of olive trees in spring of 2014.Currently there are approximately sixty thousand arbequina olive trees growing on the Hobdy Farm. After six years of hard work OLIVE ORCHARDS OF GEORGIA and the Hobdy family had our first crop. It is very satisfying to see all of our efforts and investment result in such a great product! We take pride in our Georgia grown extra virgin olive oil and its amazing taste as well as health benefits. Our vision is for the future generations of the Hobdy family……that they will carry on the tradition of providing the high-quality extra virgin olive oil that OLIVE ORCHARDS OF GEORGIA produces."

It is nice to meet you. I am Lisa Kirkpatrick the owner and founder of Elise Artisan Nuts. I am a Southerner. A woman born in Atlanta, Georgia now living in the beautiful Atlanta suburb of Sandy Springs. Growing up in the south, most are raised with a spirit of hospitality and giving. It is with spirit in mind, I created Elise Artisan Nuts.As you probably guessed, I have always loved nuts! They are my favorite go-to snack. I started creating various flavored nuts as thank you gifts. They were a hit! Pretty soon others wanted to know when I’d be making more. I’ve always enjoyed cooking, so when my daughter and son went off to college, I decided to turn my passion of gifting nuts into a business. Busy people appreciate unique, fresh food items for their own enjoyment or to give as gifts. However, time prevents many from making their own roasted nuts. This is where Elise Artisan Nuts can help. We buy the freshest nuts, then roast and flavor them in small batches in our kitchen.Treat yourself to one of our 4 flavors.Sugar and Spice (a Flavor of Georgia winner) – A delicious taste twist that starts off sweet and finishes with a whisper of heat.Herb n’ Nuts - This unlikely pairing is a delicious sensation like no other. A special blend of herbs infused with a trace of brown sugar give these nuts a surprising, sweet finish. Key Lime Crunch – Try this tangy and sweet nut for an exquisite taste treat.Simply Salted – Just a touch of salt roasted to perfection.I love experimenting with different sweet and savory combinations, so look for new flavor lineups soon.We look forward to serving you!"

Whether it was candles that had a chemical smell (or no smell at all!) or lotions and face creams that clogged pores, caused rashes, left a greasy residue, etc., Rammy felt there had to be a better solution to the problems she was experiencing.As a hobby and family-bonding experience, Rammy, Dagny and Athena began to make candles, skincare and body care products with their own recipes. Tapping their creative energy, they would whip up candles, soaps, lotions and scrubs as birthday and holiday gifts for family, friends, teachers and others in their community, personalizing each batch to their favorite scents. Over time, the candles and body products became so popular that friends and friends of friends began asking for different products – unique candles, body sprays, deodorants, diffusers, etc. Always believing in the power of “yes”, they would meticulously research and experiment with each product until they were satisfied it met their high standards for quality."

But Chris and Greg Robitaille were looking for more. They wanted to form partnerships with organizations dedicated to the conservation and preservation of our public lands and give back to the places they love. The brothers regularly donate a percentage of map sales to ongoing efforts to protect these lands. The result is a rewarding partnership combining original artwork, unique story-telling and philanthropy. These entirely custom and original maps are truly one-of-a-kind keepsakes to share with friends and family for years to come. There are simply no other maps that can compare anywhere!"

We believe Picasso was right: Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. We believe it's not what you have, it's what you give. We believe in celebrating life every day. We believe originality is king. We believe in things that have soul. We believe we are all a work in progress and patience is a virtue. We believe in brave and kind hearts. We believe in looking for the good. We believe there's no time to be bored in a world as magical as this. We believe the best therapist has fur and four paws. We believe a beautiful thing is never perfect. We believe not only in making an income, but making an impact. We believe in seizing the day. We believe life should be a splendid adventure. We believe the golden rule actually works. We believe every day is an opportunity to make a new happy ending. Above all, we believe in putting good things into the world."

I had to leave my job as a training manager for Cumberland Farms due to the move brought on by his transfer.At that time, the beaches in Naples were thick with shells and I began collecting shells and making items with them to sell.  My work became so popular that I soon began getting more orders for lamps, mirrors, and novelties than my gatherings could support and I began buying the shells from shops.  Eventually I had such a large customer base that I was able to buy shells wholesale and through my dealings with the wholesale suppliers, saw a real need for importing and selling a better quality, cleaner shell.After I had been selling shells for a couple years George joined my business.  Once the shells came in we cleaned and packaged them, and George sold them to shops.  We started out with one truck and as we outgrew it we moved the business into a 48 ft. tractor trailer showroom.
