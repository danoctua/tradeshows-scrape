At the end of his journey he brought back some beautiful hand carved wooden jewelry from a village in the mountains of Bali and began to sell these treasures to surf shops in America.

Out of the back of his grandfather's old Chevy he traveled the coasts to begin his business. He found small specialty boutiques were also fascinated with his art. While traveling, his mother Henrietta shipped to customers, from her living room and basement with the help of family, friends and neighbors. The handicrafts were well received and with trusting Balinese craftspeople to believe in him, his humble business began.

Now many years and countries later the business has developed organically into a multi line accessories business located in Hawthorne, New York. Harry is the head designer and president of the company which has grown to include a continual array of unique handbags and scarves (Christian Livingston Collection) and jewelry (Island Designs by Harry Haslett). The company exhibits in the major gift and accessories shows in New York, Atlanta, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Chicago, as well as in showrooms throughout the United States.

From these modest roots we have always stayed true to our focus of taking care of our customers and employees, who are like our extended family. In both cases many of them have been with us since the start.
Harry still travels the globe designing and looking for inspiration in back alley shops and markets in exotic locations and still manages to sneak in a surf whenever possible. Along the way he had the good fortune to meet his designer wife Erica in Bali and they now have 2 kids, Max and Cheyenne to share the joys of travel and surfing! 
We welcome you to experience our designs and found treasures and to join our growing family of friends and like-minded souls!"

Media acclaim for Seda France has been widespread and glowing, including mentions in Lucky, Domino, Vogue, Marie Claire, Cosmopolitan, Town & Country, Better Homes & Gardens and numerous other publications. Lifestyle guru, Colin Cowie, recommended Seda France candles as the ""perfect gift"" on The Oprah Winfrey Show and followed up by introducing his own line of Seda France candles on Home Shopping Network. Martha Stewart Weddings, InStyle and Tatler have all touted the company's candles as ""the gift of luxury."" The editors of Victoria Magazine swooned over the 22-ingredient holiday candle while the discerning noses at Country Home called French Tulip a ""favorite."" And O, The Oprah Magazine found the candles to be ""heaven-scented.""

The inspiration for Seda France's original collection &ndash; the Classic Toile series with its distinctive ""Pagoda box"" packaging &ndash; came from the centuries-old French ""toile de jouy"" design element, and the richly-scented candles were an immediate hit.

Both retailers and customers quickly came to expect ideal gifts and pitch-perfect packaging from Seda France. This led to new collections to satisfy the need for even more luxurious scents and incredibly creative packaging.

Color. Fragrance. Luxury. A distinctive take on those qualities and a devotion to providing top-notch commodities is what sets Seda France apart. And there's plenty more just around the corner&hellip;"

At Ranger Station, we pour each candle into what will later become your favorite cocktail glass, a sturdy keepsake and customization inspired by our founder's appreciation for a well-served drink. Our goal is to provide you with a high-quality candle that can transport you to an outdoor retreat in the confines of your daily life. Each candle is hand-poured to function as a warm additive, yet is inevitably alluring in any room. And although we perfect our scents with the nose of a modern gentleman in mind, our candles sell equally to men and women.

WHO WE ARE

Ranger Station was dreamt up and made a reality by Steve Soderholm, Founder and Chief Candlemaker. Steve has always kept a good candle lit when he's hosting friends, but had a hard time finding a candle that reproduced the aromas in the world that he loves the most. Tired of his options to either buy cheap candles from big box stores or over-priced candles that didn't quite fit his taste, he decided to start making his own. The result has turned into Ranger Station, where Steve is now releasing his wilderness-inspired scents by the batch. 

When Steve isn't pouring candles, you can find him playing drums on the road or at home in Nashville, TN, often stirring up whiskey cocktails for his friends and family in between."

Trained as a photojournalist, Donna Gorman has kept the photojournalist's instinct for connecting with details of everyday life. Her designs are often born in the images she captures with her camera during her travels to singular, eye-catching locales like Morocco, India, or rural Mexico. The photographs serve as inspiration- visual field notes- to be transformed with brush and vivid colors into paintings that are ultimately reproduced in her designs.
Donna Gorman and her work have caught the attention of those who set the standard in the design world. Decorating and design publications have run feature articles on her collections, and her work and home have been featured in publications like I.D. Magazine, Abitare and Metropolitan Home. Gorman's design work is part of the permanent collection of the Museum of Applied Arts in Munich, Germany. A frequent guest on several shows on HGTV, tapes of her appearances are being sent to key retailers across the country to promote her products.
William Morrow published her first book, ""The Artful Table"". A second is in the works, combining two of her life!s passions, travel and entertaining.
A diverse range of companies seek Gorman's particular creativity. For Seabrook Designs Gorman has created several very successful juvenile and general wallcoverings and coordinated fabric collections. For retailers like Crate&Barrel, Target, JCPenny, Bed Bath&Beyond, and Dansk, she has designed several coordinated and independent product collections of table top, bedding, and bath products.

She formed a partnership with Pate International, a highly respected San Francisco design firm known for their environmentally conscious designs, to create the brand in 2009.

It all started in 2002 when a girl (that would be me - Heather) couldn't knit. I was working on the Supercross circuit (yes, dirt bikes) traveling across the country pretty much every week. I was in desperate need of a creative outlet... a hobby. Fast forward to today, my hobby turned business (this little thing called Rinse) and has been alive & kicking for over 12 years. (If you want to hear the whole story of how it happened be sure to stop by market & just ask me).

Like it was 12 years ago, Rinse is still very much a family business which is now located in the quaint downtown of Monroe, Georgia. All of our products are still as natural as can be (most products are 98-100% natural). As always, they are produced in small batches (to ensure the quality and freshness) & they're all still made, packaged & labeled by people in our workshop. You may wonder how we get it all done... with the help of moms, of course.

We are so proud to say that our products can be found in an amazing collection of gift stores, boutiques, salons, spas, hospital gift shops, natural/organic markets as well as many other mom & pop type retail locations across the country. Our products can also be found in Walt Disney World where we are one of a handful of artisans invited each year to participate in their Epcot International Food & Wine and Flower & Garden Festivals.

Our product line includes: 100% natural Deodorants, Handmade Soaps, Skin Sticks (solid lotions), Pucker Sticks (lip balm), Peppofoot Sticks, Lotions, Oils, Scrubs, Facial Masks...All retailing between $4.00 - $16.95 with a little extra built into the price to help cover shipping.

To see our full catalog be sure to stop by our website at www.rinsesoap.com

Thanks for listening to my story & I hope you enjoy our products as much as we enjoy making them for you!

Oh, & thank goodness I couldn't knit!

The variety of traditional textiles and range of products is immense and constantly evolving to accommodate new styles and trends . This and the enthusiasm of the craftsman producing them inspired us to start Natural Habitat

We started our business with certain objectives in mind:
1.The use of traditional production techniques.
2.They must be as ecologically friendly as possible.
3.They must come from a region where cottage industries are used for production enabling them to continue their hand-made techniques profitably.

We use only natural fibres for all our hand-woven fabrics . All printing is hand printed, embroidery is hand done, applique & cutwork is hand cut and hand sewn.

Although we insist on quality control, there is a likelihood of slubs in fabric, color variations and on occasion slight inconsistencies in embroideries.


In a situation such as this where goods from a region are being sold thousands of miles away, there is bound to occur an evolution of these products into ones more appealing to that market. Our line too has immerged from it's ethnic background to accommodate our customer. We have developed bedding and table linens in dyes other than vegetable dyes. These require a lot less care and are machine washable. It also goves us a wider range of colors to play with

However, all these developments are made in keeping with our objectives. We continue to work both with traditional techniques and current trends and demands.

At the University of Illinois, studying Textile Science she learned to appreciate and recognize quality and style. She developed a discerning eye and learned to trust her instincts for design. A career in fashion and design was a foregone conclusion.
In 1984 the journey began when Jane went to New York and began working for The Perry Ellis Company. Sought after fashion editorial jobs at Redbook, Glamour and McCall's followed. In 1991 she moved to San Francisco as Fashion Director for Macy's/Bullock's West. Business travel took her to the fashion capitols of the world; Paris, Milan, London, Madrid. Jane was thrilled and inspired by the products, the designs and the cultures she encountered. Her imagination soared!
In 1994 Jane and San Francisco businessman Richard Leider were married. And shortly thereafter the adventurous couple moved to Hong Kong. Friends there introduced Jane to David Tang, owner of the luxury brand, Shanghai Tang. He asked Jane to create some products for his growing home department. Jane began traveling throughout Asia to source the best handmade items. In Vietnam, Jane discovered extraordinary hand embroideries and the seeds for her company Haute Home were sewn.

The year 1996 marked a major change for the company. We expanded our product line to include historical reproductions of Colonial, Civil War, Indian, Western and Nautical gifts. We now sell to antique shops, catalogs, national parks, theme parks, gift shops and framing galleries throughout the United States.

At first, we mounted our images on 1‚Äù metal tiles with a black cord. These became incredibly popular, and our customers wanted more. So, we expanded our designs into earrings to match.

After a few years of evolution and streamlining our processes, DC Designs Jewelry was born.

As popular as our earrings were, we found the metal tiles were heavier than we liked. By using just the gicl√©e prints of the image and a layer of UV protection, we were able to reduce the weight and create ultra-lightweight, waterproof jewelry.

For years, David Clack had the idea of taking several of his nature landscape images and layering them together, creating multiple exposure abstract images. By allowing some of the underlying images to shine through, colors and textures appear in beautiful ways. These photos from David‚Äôs Clack‚Äôs portfolio have become a part of our jewelry line, and they are incredibly popular.

Alongside the photography of David Clack, we partnered with artist Shelly Hearne. Her designs and delicate artwork are available in a wide variety of our jewelry styles.

No one produces anything quite like DC Designs Jewelry. Our earrings and pendants are one of a kind. We handcraft every one of our pieces using stunning images from Colorado and other nature landscapes. All of our products are hypo-allergenic, and contain no nickel. The ear wires are made of antique copper on steel. The prints are UV protected and water resistant. And all of our jewelry is handcrafted in our studio in Fort Collins, Colorado."

Combining our appreciation for fabulous PURE SOY candles, creative packaging and personalized gifts, we established Ella B.

Retailers were able to match our fragrances with local names, creating a unique product for their customers. We quickly grew into stores across the country. 
Since then, we have been able to add several customized candle offerings to meet the needs of our retailers. Our Private Label Program allows retailers to create their own candle line.

As a custom candle company, Ella B. Candles offers reasonable minimums, quick turnaround, and personalized attention to each candle we create. All of our candles are hand-poured in Charlotte, North Carolina using pure, un-colored soy, cotton wicks and high quality fragrance oils.

We partner with retailers to determine which Ella B. Candle line would best meet not only their needs but the needs of their customer."

Bedrock Tree Farm fir needle products were developed in 2012 because of our desire to find a use for the endless fir needle branches that are sheared to the ground and left to turn to mulch. We felt such incredibly healthy, succulent needles must be recycled and used for our benefit and 
enjoyment year round.  BINGO! Soaps, Candles, Salt Scrub and more. In doing research we found that the oils in fir needles have anti-microbial (kills bacteria, fungi), anti-septic (reduces possibility of infection), and anti-catarrhal (reduces inflammation of mucous membranes) properties.  Fir needles are known for their disinfecting properties.  Also known for aiding respiratory problems like bronchitis.  Analgesic properties make it useful in rubs for sore muscles or arthritis.  
Many of our customers would say that their Christmas tree loses that fresh cut smell after a week or so.  Tom recommended lighting a fir needle candle.  However, in our search for an authentic smelling (a scent like Tom after shearing trees all afternoon) we found it didn't exist.  So, what to do?  Put the tree in a jar.  We literally harvest branches sheared, clip off the needles, dry and grind them into a powder and that is what is in every product we make...candles, soaps, scrub, body care.  It is what sets us apart from all of the other flavor of the month candles.  It is a unique scent that you have to smell to believe.  Of course, knowing we would be eating, sleeping, and breathing these products every day to make them, we have made every attempt to ensure our health is at the lowest risk possible.  We use pure Essential oils and naturally derived fragrance oils and soy wax is 100% non-gmo.  We offer several different containers and wick types with 9 different combinations of scents that all contain the fir needle base.  "

She graduated from Kansas State University with a degree in art education and has a passion for art, antiques and product design. Her love of antiques began by unearthing treasures at garage sales with her father and attending auctions as a teenager. After a few years of collecting, her home was bursting at the seams and she knew if she wanted to continue to buy she needed to have an outlet to sell. She began selling at antique shows, opened her home for seasonal open houses and in l987 opened a retail store in Topeka, Kansas. Kristen brought her husband, Bob, onboard in l994 and together they have six children, Callie the cat and an adorable cocker-mutt named Bentley. Kristen began designing home decor in 2008 because she saw a need in the home decor industry for stylish, yet affordable, products. Her designs are inspired by the wonderful homes, gardens and antique shops she sees on her antique hunting excursions in Europe. She is especially intrigued by the country of Belgium and the Belgian style of decorating: similar to French only pared down, rustic yet refined, repurposed, bare woods, and the most beautiful things aren't always the finest. All pieces in the White x White collection are hand-made and have a wonderful vintage appearance with finishes that vary slightly from piece to piece. It's our belief that these slight variations add character and charm to the products and should in no way be considered defects. We hope you are as excited as we are about our line and we truly appreciate your business.

Since the beginning, Simon‚Äôs life has centered around functional, sophisticated design. Growing up in Ireland with a family of artisans, attention to detail and aesthetics were part of his everyday experience. At age 16, Simon began his craft as an apprentice at his father‚Äôs pottery studio. From there, he went on to work with notable glassmakers all over Europe before opening his namesake studio. Inspired by centuries-old Georgian glassmaking techniques and using the finest natural materials, Simon set out to create designs that bring pleasure and inspiration with every use, every day.
In the age of bigger, better, faster, we believe simplicity, quality, and artisanship are tenets of a better way of life. From our hand-thrown pottery to our lead-free glassware made with custom molds and purpose-built furnaces, each handcrafted piece carries a story that lends meaning, authenticity, and grace to every use.  From our heritage of craftsmanship to design that‚Äôs meant to last for generations, everything we do is in service of creating a table to gather with the people we love. These moments of togetherness are what inspire us.

MADE IN USA:
Lux is an American company located in central Texas. We hand pour every candle at our factory to ensure our consistent quality.
WAX:
The formula is a proprietary blend of very expensive, fully refined quality waxes and scientifically developed additives. The formula was developed to enable the wax to ""layer"" the fragrance oil in a new way.
Lux candles does not use soy wax because of the odor that is difficult to mask and because soy does not have the ability to ""throw"" (meaning flood) the fragrance in a room. Soy does burn somewhat cleaner, but will not hold more than 8% fragrance oil.
The #1 reason consumers buy candles today is for FRAGRANCE."

Arra‚Äôs creative spirit, mind, and hands fashion ways to transform these natural materials into well-designed, innovative works of art.

Nature‚Äôs enduring forces of sun, wind, rain, and mighty waves provide the materials. Sea Stones brings the human elements of care, compassion, and respect for the environment by creating each unique piece by hand in harmony with nature‚Äôs gifts.

The Artists  
 
 
Arra David:
Working with stone calls for custom fixtures and techniques. Arra is an engineer and furniture maker, and it‚Äôs part of his normal care and feeding to put him in the workshop and let him make tools.
 
Anne Johnson:
Anne is an artist with a keen eye for balance and harmony. She blends the endless varieties of nature's materials into pieces that decorate homes and will keep generations connected to their environment."

Hard Tail was conceived on the notion of premium tee-shirts with tattoo-inspired designs evoking that inner rockstar. The evolution of mobility, spirit and color had begun. In 2004, the company began manufacturing a high-end denim line built on the same tenants of quality, style and comfort&mdash;you really want to live in these jeans.
Hard Tail is known industry-wide for having the best ""dyeing"" process. The deep, rich and fruity colors that created are no accident, but rather a complicated, intricate process that remains a ""family secret."" Cantrell's business philosophy, ""always made in the U.S.A."" is a natural progression stemming from his Air Force fighter pilot days. His discipline, determination and true grit are the building blocks of legends&mdash;and the building blocks of legendary brands. The Hard Tail revolution hits a high note in May 2005 with the grand opening of its first retail store in Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, a stone's throw away from the company's headquarters. The light, bright and airy environment is more SoHo artists loft than retail store.

When Gold Tech opened its doors for the first time, we brought more than 20 years of hands-on jewelry making experience as well as centuries of traditional jewelry wisdom learned through apprenticeship. Back in September 28 of 1994, only a small portion of jewelry artisans were aware of improvements that could be brought to jewelry manufacturing by the use of technology. Our appreciation of technology led us to delve into merging our love of jewelry designing with technology. More than 15 years later, today we are still changing and adding to our services to improve jewelry manufacturing at the speed of technology.



Gold Tech Values
At Gold Tech, we highly value honesty, integrity, and professionalism. We believe that ethical conduct of business and determination to do the right thing are vital to the success of not just our company but all businesses. Because of this, we strive very hard to work with companies and individuals which respect the same values. We hope to create long term relationship with our clients and satisfy their needs to the fullest without jeopardizing our values.



Gold Tech Standards

Her father's career was cut short when he was stricken with an extremely aggressive cancer, at a very young age.
Twenty years later, two children and half a world away from those treasured childhood memories of her native Hong Kong, she was overcome finding those same types of decorations, in a Christmas store, in upstate New York.
Catherine does not believe that was the catalyst that brought her into the gift industry, but she does believe that her father would be very proud of the business that she has created.
From the very beginnings with decorative products that she crafted herself by hand, up until now, with a unique and eclectic mixture of holiday items, gifts, decorative and personal accessories she has created an extremely attractive, one stop shopping experience for all the retailers that are her friends and followers. She was at the forefront of the move to introduce personal accessories to the gift market.
Catherine has imbued her whole team with the spirit that her customers have to be successful for her business to be successful.  She is constantly searching for new and innovative products, colors, ideas and trends to bring to her customers.
She and her team all hope that you will enjoy and profit from the experience of shopping in her showrooms and on her website."

At the same time, she has grown a successful niche business called s.a.l.t. sisters in rural America with an exceptionally determined entrepreneurial spirit.

Charmane's motivation to create, deliver and distribute an exceptional food product stems from a passion for Nature's most essential elements and for her strong familial ties. The brand name (s.a.l.t sisters) is an acronym for her four daughters: Sydney, Alexis, Lauren and Taylor.

Armed with the knowledge of the incredible benefits of unprocessed and unrefined sea salt she sourced and packaged a product under the s.a.l.t. sisters label and scheduled herself to appear at regional farmers markets each week to sell product in 2007. From those humble roots the product line grew in popularity and led to an expansion of its offerings in 2009. Thus, along with a strong portfolio of unrefined sea salt, the company staked a claim in organic cane sugars (c.a.n.e), seasoning rubs (r.u.b.s), vanilla infusion kits (b.e.a.n), and natural herb blends (h.e.r.b) and most recently all natural dip blends (d.i.p.s) and specially blended rooibos and herbal teas (t.e.a.s). The wide ranging palate of the brand commanded the attention of a wholesale market and many discernible chefs. The products even received a nod from Giada De Laurentiis in a 2009 segment of holiday gift ideas for NBC's TODAY show, in 2013 Clean Eating endorsed both the Mediterranean r.u.b.s. and the vanilla infusion kit as part of their Clean Choice Awards, and that same year Fox 5 News ran a feature about the products.

What started as a personal endeavor to educate the populous on the many benefits of unrefined salt has blossomed into a business venture based in Goshen, Indiana comprised of fifteen employees and a healthy distribution of product in 44 stat"

We design products to insulate your favorite things and elevate your everyday. Whether you‚Äôre commuting, caravanning, cycling, catching a plane or catching some rays, we want to keep you cool every step of the way.

Everything we make, from Drinkware to Cooler Bags to Lunchboxes and Accessories, is designed with intention. Innovation is at the core of what we do.  That's why we refine details like ergonomic, flat sides for an easier grip. Or high-fashion, handbag-inspired tote bags that also happen to be exceptional coolers. How can we tweak ordinary things to make them extraordinary? How can we add value to everyday moments? These challenges excite and push us to create stuff with meaning."

So far, we agree that the world is watery. While we wait for our big breakthrough, we'll continue to pursue one of our earlier discoveries: people seem to really like intellectual giants reduced to little finger puppets and mugs, and subject to witty jokes. 

At the Unemployed Philosophers Guild, we like to kill two birds with one stone.* We make people laugh and earn enough money to sit around reading Spinoza and raising our families.

Yes, we think deeply about the things we do and the objects we bring into this world. Our CEP (Chief Executive Philosopher) personally tested the Kierkegaard finger puppet while reading Hegel's ""Geisteswissenschaften"" to determine Kierkegaard did not know shit about Hegel. Our staff conducted temporal thought experiments while wearing UPG Einstein Relativity Watches. Subsequent to eating a Will to Power Bar, an Associate Philosopher had the energy to declare ""God is dead"" and be on time for schul. 

Suffice it to say we're proud to return philosophy to the days of Thales, when a philosopher could brandish a few crackpot ideas, make a living, and make the world a better place. Part of every purchase you make goes to philosophically profound causes, such as lunch and gold plated faucets in the Ivory Tower bathrooms. As Aristotle said: &tau;&omicron; &omicron;&nu; &lambda;&epsilon;&gamma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota; &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&chi;&omega;s! 

Plus, we make puppets. Do you trust anyone who doesn't like puppets?

I had to leave my job as a training manager for Cumberland Farms due to the move brought on by his transfer.
At that time, the beaches in Naples were thick with shells and I began collecting shells and making items with them to sell.  My work became so popular that I soon began getting more orders for lamps, mirrors, and novelties than my gatherings could support and I began buying the shells from shops.  Eventually I had such a large customer base that I was able to buy shells wholesale and through my dealings with the wholesale suppliers, saw a real need for importing and selling a better quality, cleaner shell.
After I had been selling shells for a couple years George joined my business.  Once the shells came in we cleaned and packaged them, and George sold them to shops.  We started out with one truck and as we outgrew it we moved the business into a 48 ft. tractor trailer showroom.  George and I had two young daughters and they started making shell crafts along with us.  (The beginning of a ""family"" business.)
In 1981 we moved to Ellenton in order to be more central to our customer base.  We set up two tractor trailer showrooms and my brother, Ed, came to work with us.  Our daughters worked with us until they married, moved away and both became nurses. 
With our tractor trailer showrooms we started selling from the east coast of New Jersey, down through the Carolinas, all of Florida and as far west as Mississippi.  We broke these states up into 10 established routes that George and Ed continue to visit every 3 to 4 weeks.
We set up a showroom in our warehouse in Palmetto; here we import, clean, package and sell the shells, as well as related items.  We import 40ft. containers of shells from"

Andre Gabricht was a child when his love affair with traditional Eastern European folk art began. While traveling through the many famous art villages with his father, young Andre was mesmerized as he would watch these artisans work the craft that had been passed down to them through many generations. In each village where he traveled to, he found local artists, each with the specialty of carving faces and eyes, illustrational painting &ndash; masters of their skill.

Seeing the excellence in those artists work, he decided to create the perfect artistry. By passing those different stages of creating to the ""hands of experts in the style"" for the best woodcarving, best ornamental and decorative painting work in multi technique from all different art villages, Andre with his specially trained artists start working to bring excellence, beauty and character to every piece they imagine. Each figure, ornament, and treasured piece is freehand painted by talented artists to bring you a lifetime of unequaled joy.

Now G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios is a small, family-owned business dedicated to creating works of art using century-old techniques for your appreciation and enjoyment. The studio is focusing on creating special unique handcrafted Holiday Artistry for the gift givers and collectors. G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios is supporting and preserving folk art for the future generations. In today's technology and information revolution, we feel a responsibility to save Folk Art, along with all the creative techniques used. G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios has become home for talented masters of decorative art, where we continue in the old traditions just as it has been done for generations.

Andre Gabricht was a child when his love affair with traditional Eastern European folk art began. While traveling through the many famous art villages with his father, young Andre was mesmerized as he would watch these artisans work the craft that had been passed down to them through many generations. In each village where he traveled to, he found local artists, each with the specialty of carving faces and eyes, illustrational painting &ndash; masters of their skill.

Seeing the excellence in those artists work, he decided to create the perfect artistry. By passing those different stages of creating to the ""hands of experts in the style"" for the best woodcarving, best ornamental and decorative painting work in multi technique from all different art villages, Andre with his specially trained artists start working to bring excellence, beauty and character to every piece they imagine. Each figure, ornament, and treasured piece is freehand painted by talented artists to bring you a lifetime of unequaled joy.

Now G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios is a small, family-owned business dedicated to creating works of art using century-old techniques for your appreciation and enjoyment. The studio is focusing on creating special unique handcrafted Holiday Artistry for the gift givers and collectors. G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios is supporting and preserving folk art for the future generations. In today's technology and information revolution, we feel a responsibility to save Folk Art, along with all the creative techniques used. G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios has become home for talented masters of decorative art, where we continue in the old traditions just as it has been done for generations.

Her exuberance as a design thinker has always taken center stage. For 30 years, she was Creative Director of an award-winning branding agency with offices in New York and Sydney. Now, after two successful exhibitions in Australia and M√©xico and her first commissioned public art installation in New York City, van de Wiel is reinterpreting her black-and-white-abstract art across a limited edition collection of accessories, fashion, fabrics, furniture and more. ‚ÄúAfter all, art has a pulse. It belongs in every day life. Not just on walls,‚Äù she says.

Scaling down images of her paintings and working with printers, artisans and makers in M√©xico City and Le√≥n, she created an eclectic collection of faux leather messenger bags, totes and zippered portfolios that spark the wearer‚Äôs style statement. In addition, she collaborated with master weavers to design the first BLC Wool Collection of rugs and 2m long throws. Hand-woven and using ethically sourced wool from Guanajuato, each one-of-a-kind piece is also adapted from a BLC original. Watch this space!"

crosses, soon to be renowned Haitian 
artist Georges Liautaud ‚Ä¶ and so 
began Haitian metal art. The original 
raw material was iron, but with many 
goods shipped to Haiti in 55-gallon 
steel oil drums, there was a ready 
supply of discarded drums for the 
artisans.¬†Over the years the 
number of Haitian metal artists has 
multiplied via families and mentor / 
students embracing the craft. The 
center of Haitian metal arts is the 
village of Croix-des-Bouquets, where 
the clang-clang of metal on metal, the 
hammers banging out the sculptures, 
is a constant music. The artisans start 
with designs inspired by nature and 
culture. From cardboard patterns, they 
trace their design with chalk on the 
flattened metal from torn-down oil 
drums. With chisels and hammers, by 
hand they carefully cut and decorate 
the metal. Each piece is shaped and 
smoothed, then the artists boldly and 
proudly chisel their name on to the 
metal sculpture.¬†Beyond 
Borders has been working with and 
nurturing Haitian metal artists in Croix-
des-Bouquets for fifteen years. We 
meet directly with them to ensure that 
quality and craftsmanship standards 
remain high. We love the constant 
exchange and blossoming of new 
product and design ideas. Most 
importantly, we see real economic 
improvement and lives bettered 
through the creation and sharing of 
their beautiful art. This success is 
about a true partnership between the 
Haitian artists, Beyond Borders, and You!"

Andre Gabricht was a child when his love affair with traditional Eastern European folk art began. While traveling through the many famous art villages with his father, young Andre was mesmerized as he would watch these artisans work the craft that had been passed down to them through many generations. In each village where he traveled to, he found local artists, each with the specialty of carving faces and eyes, illustrational painting &ndash; masters of their skill.

Seeing the excellence in those artists work, he decided to create the perfect artistry. By passing those different stages of creating to the ""hands of experts in the style"" for the best woodcarving, best ornamental and decorative painting work in multi technique from all different art villages, Andre with his specially trained artists start working to bring excellence, beauty and character to every piece they imagine. Each figure, ornament, and treasured piece is freehand painted by talented artists to bring you a lifetime of unequaled joy.

Now G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios is a small, family-owned business dedicated to creating works of art using century-old techniques for your appreciation and enjoyment. The studio is focusing on creating special unique handcrafted Holiday Artistry for the gift givers and collectors. G.DeBrekht Artistic Studios is supporting and preserving folk art for the future generations. In today's technology and information revolution, we feel a responsibility to save Folk Art, along with all the creative techniques used.

We believe mother nature is the best artist. We believe our lives should be love letters to the world. We believe in being great and full, but mostly grateful. We believe Picasso was right: Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life. We believe it's not what you have, it's what you give. We believe in celebrating life every day. We believe originality is king. We believe in things that have soul. We believe we are all a work in progress and patience is a virtue. We believe in brave and kind hearts. We believe in looking for the good. We believe there's no time to be bored in a world as magical as this. We believe the best therapist has fur and four paws.

We created Papersalt to put more good content into the world. Our gifts are intended to help you spread inspiration, kindness, joy and laughs.

HOW WE STARTED
Founded in 2012 by four parents, we set out to create inspiring and educational content for kids and families, boiled down to the ‚Äúneed-to-knows.‚Äù

A LOOK AT US TODAY
In addition to our original Papersalt content, you‚Äôll now find collections based on icons like Bob Ross and Fred Rogers, as well as hit TV shows and films like The Office and The Shrek Series. 

A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE
As our brand continues to grow, our goal remains the same as day one ‚Äì to create gifts that will help you spread inspiration, kindness, joy and laughs.

NOT JUST ANOTHER BOOK
We wanted to make things differently than what we'd seen out there.  We started with our signature line of books using extremely thick paper and wire-o binding, so the books lay flat - with simple content and bold designs to engage readers.

The line now includes over 200 products ‚Äì from magnets to stickers to lunch notes ‚Äì all with the same quality and content in mind.
