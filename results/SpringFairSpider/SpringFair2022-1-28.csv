Scattered amongst the many tales of hardship, derring do and wonders seen, where one was expected to ""keep a stiff upper lip, regardless"", were found meticulously detailed lists of exotic ingredients for use in the Captain's very own grooming requisites.

It's a 2-4 player game to be enjoyed in the garden, a park, a beach or anywhere with outdoor space. THE COMPANY It was developed in lockdown by a single one man team Henry Marks as his work as a self-employed experience designer vanished overnight. Creating this product has been a long ambition of his as the game was created from a summer holiday with friends back in 2010. He knew there was potential but the make-shift game was terrible! He made a promise to himself that he would launch it as a properly designed product and it's now ready for the world to play. It is the combination of his two passions: his love for the outdoors and design.

Andrew says: “Our mission has always been to build long term relationships with customers and retain their loyalty by continuing to source and develop new products, whilst maintaining a core range of proven and trusted ranges. We work very closely with our ceramic suppliers in the heart of Andalusia, Spain, most being third generation family run businesses. This has allowed us to bring stunning hand painted ceramics for the home and garden to be enjoyed here in the UK.  We have also been able to create many bespoke ranges for customers who want something specific for their own customer base or to relate to their particular brand. We offer one of the most comprehensive ranges of Olive Wood in the UK. Our ethically sourced Tunisian Olive Wood is totally sustainable. Caring for, and protecting our environment is something we are passionate about here at DD. Our ""Recycled Glass"" collections have become more popular of over the years as consumers are looking at how they can help the enviroment.  The amount of energy to melt recycled glass is considerably less than needed to melt raw materials. Soy Wax is our choice for our Home Fragrance Luxury candles.  Clean burning and releasing no harmful toxins they are again kinder to the environment and kinder to the home. Hand poured here in the UK these beautifully designed and gift boxed candles and diffusers bring stylish, beautiful and unique scents to the home. We also have a range of soy wax candles poured into re-usable ceramic and olive wood bowls. I am very lucky to be working with a very dedicated and loyal team here at Divine Distribution.  We are a “true” family and work together to make Divine Distribution the best it can be.

We work hard to make our kits environmentally friendly and to that end we have just introduced compostable bags.  There is no single use plastic in our packaging and in recognition of our efforts we have recently been voted the most environmental gin making kits on the market by BBC Good Food Magazine. We invest heavily in our pre-packed gin recipes to ensure a fool proof result every time. And, as our kits only contain dry ingredients there is no need for an alcohol licence to retail them. We have just been short-listed for the Gift of the Year Awards which is a great as we love our beautiful packing and hope the judges will too."

For more than 20 years the Kaloo brand has been specializing in soft toys and bedding accessories. Kaloo is now present in nearly 40 countries.

A colourful collection of 5 in 1 educational beads to help with children’s development needs through the early stages of learning. The products are designed to push, pull, twist, thread and build whilst having fun with the new cute Lalaboom characters. And finally, the newest addition to the Juratoys family, Lillipuitens. Created in 1995 by two friends, the brand has embarked on a quest to create the very best soft toys……Mission accomplished!

On seeing a large stack of honey jars in one house, a grumpy 9 year old Neve pipes up, “Why have you got all that honey?” to which the owner of the honey replies, “Because I have bees” “What, they make all that honey!” “Yes, and they make wax & propolis and pollinate lots of flowers & trees” Neve was blissfully quiet for the rest of the afternoon; then later, “I think we should live in that house with those bees. I’ve spoken with Grandad Jim and he's getting me a beehive for my birthday” Starting from this one hive, and with help from some wonderful local beekeepers and crafts-folk, Neve's Bees was born!"

A pioneer and innovator in the field of lower-limb biomechanics, Vasyli treated thousands of patients, ranging from young children to amateur and professional athletes. Known by friends and colleagues as a ""born healer"", he had a genuine passion for making orthotic treatment more affordable and accessible to people in need of pain relief. Early in his career, Vasyli realised that the only treatment options for many common foot-related ailments, like plantar fasciitis or over-pronation, were costly and time-consuming. In response to the overwhelming demand for a solution, he invented one of the first heat-mouldable orthotics, a low-cost option that allowed patients to walk out of his practice feeling better than when they'd come in. This philosophy laid the groundwork for the award-winning FMT Technology orthotic, the world's first and only true orthotic available without a doctor's prescription. Vasyli's creation revolutionised the industry and paved the way for limitless innovation in the footwear field, laying the groundwork for VIONIC's stylish range of shoes, sandals, boots and orthotics. A groundbreaking study shows VIONIC sandals effectively alleviate heel pain*. *Based on a peer-reviewed clinical study partially funded by VIONIC on people experiencing moderate, non-traumatic heel pain.  VIONIC shoes provide essential stability and addictive support. With a contour seamlessly engineered into each shoe, sandal and slipper, VIONIC helps support natural alignment from the ground up."

Our mission is to make a small but positive difference in a kind and thoughtful way, both through the products we sell and the way we operate. The materials, community and process behind our products are just as important as the final plastic-free product. We started making beeswax wraps in our kitchens in early 2017 in a bid to cut as much plastic as possible from our lives. A few ruined irons and a lot of perfecting our secret wax blend later, and we’ve created a product (and a brilliant little company!) that we are incredibly proud of. We are an independent and female-led company, and would not be where we are today without the wonderfully powerful team of people who make and shape our business. We are more than just a company with owners and employees, we are a community, we are all collaborators, and we are committed. Alongside our award-winning wraps, we also offer a collection of simple plastic-free creations including kits and bundles, rewax bars and more. Our mission is this: Simple creations to help you waste less."

The Art File also have a multi award winning Christmas collection, which is widely regarded as one of the most successful festive collections in the industry. Our industry has witnessed a remarkable recovery in recent months demonstrating once again that greeting cards remain relevant to the population, perhaps more so than ever before. The ingenuity of brilliant retailers across the land, working hard to attract customers into their stores with great service and imaginative merchandising, have helped fuel this welcome return. That’s why now more than ever, we believe the best way to support our customers throughout the coming year is to continue to publish new designs and collections which marry the highest level of creativity with quality materials and cutting edge print technology. We’ll be launching 170 new card and wrap designs from some of the most talented designers in the UK in the first half of 2022. Ink & Shadows, Curio, You the Man and Open Skies are just some of the beautiful collections we have for you from our multi-award winning in-house design team. In addition, we are delighted to announce a new collaboration with Ulla Klopf  & Ute Baurecker from Pabuku. If that’s not enough we also have a brand new look from the amazing Robert Reader, creator of the hugely successful Ink Press. Having fallen in love with our award-winning Fierce & Fabulous collection, customers have asked us for a male counterpart, and we have delivered! You The Man is fashion-forward yet relatable in its designs, inspired by men’s fashion magazines and editorial typography. Proudly celebrating diversity and empowerment, You The Man is timeless and sophisticated, and we’re sure you’ll find the perfect card for the man in your life in this collection by Beth Kemp! A further exciting and brand new collection to highlight is ‘Bear’ by Robert Reader ( the award winning artist behind the timeless Ink Press collection). This everyday collection features the Bear and his friends, Robert has combined loveable characters, charming words and a warm, earthy colour palette to create this unique collection that will have  a wide appeal, these cards are finished with tasteful debossing and framed with ivory envelopes. We are foreseeing this to be an extremely hot collection for the forthcoming campaign. On the other end of the spectrum is Open Skies, a stunning collection of cards hand-painted by Lucie Cox. Taking inspiration from Impressionism, this range depicts soaring birds, vast coastlines, sprawling flower fields, and beautiful open skies. The idyllic outdoor scenery gives a feeling of fresh air, wide open spaces, and warm sunny days. As always, this collection has tasteful finishes on a high-quality board. Alongside Open Skies, Lucie has illustrated a beautiful collection of 16 expertly hand drawn animal designs in a collection called Ink & Shadow. The striking black and white images are set within a debossed edge and framed within a light grey envelope. These cards will have mass appeal and are sure to make an impact on display, and are printed on a untextured board produced in the Lake District. We were thrilled to announce a new licence for 2022 with Ulla and Ute. Pabuku is a bold and unapologetic collection, perfect for anyone who is open-minded and loves a bit of fun. These talented artists have created a whimsical and distinctive collection full of colour and positive messages. We have a host of other exciting releases, including new designs from our best-selling Sara Miller London collection and new designs from the popular Kate Heiss. We also have exciting new Gift Packaging ranges, all which can be seen when we officially launch at Spring Fair (Hall 3, Stand P11). We revamped a large part of our Christmas collection to become more sustainable and environmentally friendly both in 2020 and 2021. This included the introduction of new fully recyclable packaging on our now three time Henry winning Christmas Luxury Boxes. The new packaging took the already successful collection to the next level, and we feel was one of the main reasons why customers kept, and keep voting for this Collection in the best Luxury Box category. We have some fantastic new designs in store for 2022 in this format. Alongside our Luxury Boxes, we also revamped the packaging on our popular Trio Boxes , and 3D Form Pop up card boxes- which were all very warmly received by customers.  For 2022- we have revamped the packaging of our very popular Charity Pack cards, which we are delighted to announce are now fully recyclable. We have introduced a Glassine band ( fully recyclable) which goes around the Pack of 6 cards and envelopes neatly, and keeps the product together. The Glassine band will have the Respected Charities Logo on also- which is important for continued exposure. Speaking of Charities- We are absolutely delighted to introduce a 4th Charity that we’ll be working with – the MND association, one of the only charities that are actively searching and researching for a cure to Motor Neurones Disease. A charity which has recently come a lot closer to ours, and many hearts in our great industry.  The revamp of our Charity Pack packaging will mean that all Art File’s Christmas Boxed and packaged product will be plastic free, and therefore sustainable and environmentally friendly.  On the gift packaging side, Our new bags will all be laminate free, meaning that the product will be able to recycled fully along side other paper products. One of the largest challenges for us during our continued Sustainability campaign has been the Cello that surrounds our popular Roll Wraps. We are absolutely delighted to announce that after much testing and trialling with key retailers, the roll wrap is now cello free!  Head onto our stand at Spring Fair to see how it works.

All of our mixes are great for bees, butterflies and other garden wildlife , and our growing product range includes something for all retailers. Created by conservation scientists , Seedball offers a new twist on an ancient technique for increasing seed germination rates - helping to fill our gardens, balconies and window boxes with native wildflowers, bees and butterflies. Native wildflowers are naturally slow to germinate, and as such, loosely scattered seed can often be eaten by ants and birds. Seedball helps to solve this problem by encasing the seed in a protective ball of clay, compost and chilli. Seed balls are incredibly easy to use - simply scatter on top of soil or compost and nature will do the rest."

Like a magpie I began collecting sea glass.... Today I forage my sea glass in picturesque Folkestone. The glass is more tumbled as the beaches are stoney. This sea glass tumbling malarkey takes many years to polish glass smooth. Approximately 20 -100 years and more! Where I find my sea glass, I believe there was a Victorian glass factory and therefore my sea glass is over 100 years old. I am a proud litter picker the beaches of Victorian rubbish! The cards I make use very small and thin pieces of sea glass. As I’ve aged my eyesight has seriously deteriorated with old age and I wear very strong reading glass, so I literally lie on the beach with my nose to the ground doing quality control on the beach. I only use thin pieces which can be posted as a first class or second class letter so I don’t pick up every piece I find. I hunt for sea glass all year around, even when the ground is frosted and it’s 3 degrees. This is some dedication! Bolt doesn’t mind as he’s a Labrador and swims all year round. I take a flask of coffee with me and have my iPod listening to music, yes I am that free spirit singing and dancing on the beach (if you see me)! All credit to Bolt as he’s the star of the show.

Addictive little colourful balls that bring smiles and happiness to everyone who receives them. Our fabulous stockists many of whom are also small, boutique businesses specialising in super quality items, continue to support us simply because their customers just love pom poms too!

Mood Bears are not just a cuddly toy. They have been specifically designed to support mental health and wellbeing, and allow children, and adults, to express themselves when words fail them. They are not just a fun way to support children and adults as they negotiate all manner of emotions and feelings but they have also become a tool that can be used to teach and educate children, and adults, about emotions, feelings, and moods. Not everyone has the learning or language abilities to express themselves vocally, but by using the bears with their recognisable colours and symbols we can facilitate communication and emotional expression. The Mood Bears were originally created to support children and adults who may struggle to understand or communicate their emotions. The bears have grown to be so much more than this and even if you do have the capacity to express how you feel, sometimes it is just too difficult to talk, sometimes you just need a hug and some silent support. There are now 8 Bears in total, each one representing a different feeling, emotion, or mood. Safety tested toy made from 100% recycled postconsumer polyester and is 100% recyclable via textile recycling. This toy complies to EN71 parts 1,2 and 3, ASTM F963 and IOS 8124 toy safety standards and is suitable for all ages."

From an early age, my passion for art and creativity led to an art foundation course and a degree specialism in Textile Design. I found an outlet for my desire to create outstanding, personal products in the bespoke card industry. The idea of composing a design that could add an extra sparkle to a special occasion or support someone through a difficult moment in their life was especially appealing. We started to design some cards which were sold locally and since then have never looked back. We have since expanded into a wide range of stationery including notecards, prints, greeting cards and even ceramics to serve any occasion. Our vision is to develop a brand that is consistent, familiar, and heartfelt. We want to provide card and card-related products that are produced as sustainably as possible. Simply put, we will only promote products that meet our stringent manufacturing guidelines. All Marina B products are all made with love and in the UK free of production shortcuts."

It all started after graduating from university. I was suddenly on my own in the real world (scary) & it was time to create my own destiny. So after many (huge) slices of cake & cups of coffee it all began… CARDS TO KEEP. Throwing away greetings cards has always given me a headache. I'd often find myself piling up my birthday cards, putting them in a draw, only to stumble across them again & feel the same guilt about having to put the lovely messages people had sent me, in the bin! I'm slightly addicted to sweet food, & rather partial to a cocktail (or two), so that's where my idea came from… I don't profess to being an amazing baker, (however I have won a rosette for my chocolate brownies!), but I love sharing these easy recipes with my friends & family, & it's great to think that other people can now do the same with my greetings cards! This means the cards can be kept forever and reused... great for the environment.  I bake, style & photograph all of my cards, & of course enjoy the end product!"

What started off as a quiet bite to eat and a catch up with good friends, swapping stories of all the hysteria of Christmas, turned into a brainstorming evening of what would follow, the founding of Lara-May January 2019. It wasn’t long before covering most topics that evening that we went onto the subject of work, we felt that we were at a crossroads, a change was needed. We knew that in an ever-evolving world where the demand for recycling was on the rise and online marketplaces were leading the way. The only way forward was to take the plunge and step into the E-commerce world, we knew not only did we have to provide a high-quality product but equally as important we had to match that with exceptional customer service. With the help of our friends who are 4th generation heel and sole-makers, we were able to tap into the recycled leather market and we began creating a recycled leather placemat and coaster range in an exciting range of current trending interior colours that will go with most decors. We can proudly say that our product is 76% recycled leather with the remainder 24% made up of a bonded rubber, creating a heat resistant mat to 90 degrees. Although we purchase our raw product from Recycling Plants in Europe which incidentally started of here in the UK all other aspects are manufactured and then lovingly packed and finished by hand in the UK. Only recently have we taken delivery of our new Lara-May packaging, all placemats will come beautifully presented, so you can be rest assured that it will make the perfect gift."

Fresh out of the sea, salt in their hair, laughing, joking and totally carefree, they were having an absolute blast. That was the essence, right there, of Joe Browns - FUN, SPONTANEOUS AND FREE! Simon decided there and then that this remarkable spirit would make the foundations of a great brand. The mission? To make people feel great! Joe Browns have been creating remarkable clothing collections bursting with unique styles that customers want to wear time and time again since 1998. Bold colours, bright patterns, fabulous silhouettes and high quality, distinctive detailing make the collections unique and iconic… it would be a shame to stop at clothing wouldn’t it?! Our Homeware  In 2019 Joe Browns launched their first ever homeware collection, injecting the same spirit and passion possessed by their garments into each wonderfully unique homeware range, enabling customers to celebrate being a true individual. They take influence from all over the world, which is evident from their bold colour palettes to their exotic animal prints, meaning their customers are always guaranteed to find something a little different from the traditional high-street offerings. Every piece has a story to tell! It’s the small details and special finishing touches that make their collections stand out from the crowd and ensure your home - and now garden - is fabulously unique. Simon Brown, founder and managing director of Joe Browns, said: “We’ve approached homewares in the same creative way as we approach our clothing styles - developing wonderfully unique pieces that offer something a little different to the traditional offering. Our designers work incredibly hard to create remarkable pieces that add an individual touch to our customer’s homes - as we do their wardrobes.”"

Whilst planning their wedding, bride to be Georgina sought out to source bespoke candles for favours as well as to help create a scent to fill their rustic barn venue. Ever the crafter, Pinterest enthusiast and self confessed penny-pincher Georgina began her journey to creating her own candles bespoke to their big day. Presented in jam jars, made using her Granny's jam pot; decorated with twine and kraft labels, and scented with rhubarb and plums, the candles were enjoyed by the couple's family and friends throughout the day and the weeks that followed. After falliing in love with the candle making process the couple decided to put their new found skills to good use and Ivy & Twine was born. Each candle is still lovingly hand poured by Georgina, using only ethically sourced and sustainable ingredients. The process of preparing the candles in small batches ensures they are all finished to a high quality and standard. The 190g candles the company is most known for offer a 40 hour+ burn time and are highly fragranced offering a long lasting scent to fill any room. Each scent has been carefully chosen, tried and tested to ensure the best burn and fragrance throw. Rhubarb & Plum Noir was the very first of which and the scent the couple chose for their wedding candles. The range now extends to Wax Melts, Diffusers and Refills and Soaps and Lotions."

Our new home boasts spectacular countryside views, whilst the solar panels adorning the warehouse roof and maize being digested on the farm to create electricity are constant reminders of the site’s environmental credentials. “2020 brought a raft of challenges as we adjusted how we do things in response to COVID-19.  During this period, we decided to use the ‘quiet’ time to plan the next chapter of our business.  This has led to IOT taking on the role of UK Distributor for some amazing brands over the last 18 months. We recognise the desire for sustainable toys, produced by ethically and socially responsible manufacturers and the brands we offer reflect those values.  Ten years after the very first toy was despatched from our premises, we are now proud to be one of the only toy companies in the UK to offer a ‘one stop shop’ for all your sustainable toy needs!” Understanding is key; the understanding that sustainability is not just about reducing plastic packaging, but also about the choices being made by consumers today, on behalf the children who will inherit this planet. ‘ Don’t gift a toy that will cost the earth’ … your customers should feel safe in the knowledge that they are buying a great quality, reasonably priced toy, that will also have minimal impact on the environment – and we can help with that!  Our point-of-sale materials are designed to share key brand messages so that you don’t have to.

Supplying the Toy and Gift trade for over thirty years, Funtime Gifts helps recreate distant memories at the same time as inventing future ones. It's huge array of novelty gifts and toys provide something for everyone. Founder Malcolm Ford, first ventured into the puzzle and gift market while studying civil engineering at Loughborough University in 1969 and with two other engineers, formulated a range of complex 3D puzzles to test the brain, hand and eye coordination. These were launched for the first time in 1972 and led to the foundation of Funtime Gifts. Funtime is probably best revered for bringing the Disco Dancing Flowers and the singing fish â Big Mouth Billy Bass â to these shores. Nowadays in the world of iPhones and iPads, electronics and synchronisation in toys are taken totally for granted; twenty years ago it was unseen and was quite ground breaking. Today Funtime is still breaking the mould with guns that fire air, animals that laugh, lasers that turn your ceiling into a planetarium, the world's smallest Walkie Talkies and so much moreâ¦ Many items continue to stand the test of time, Pin Art and Newton's cradle on p43 and Spiral and Rainbow timers on p44 (and many more) have been in and out of the range for the last thirty years and will surely continue for many more to come. Somewhat unusually for the toy trade the catalogue runs from September each year, bringing you the latest in innovation and fun for Christmas that year, along with a major new product supplement in February. There are also regular newsletters and emails throughout the year. Many of the items in this catalogue cannot be found elsewhere. Along with making and packaging many of their own exclusive items such as the range of Impossipuzzles, Funtime also has exclusive distributorships with innovative manufacturers such as Can You Imagine, Gemmy and Westminster. The Hong Kong office was established twelve years ago to handle the FOB direct import business to customers around the world, and can also assist in sourcing product. The quality and compliance of any item supplied is of the utmost importance. All items conform to the appropriate standards and are packaged and labelled appropriately. If you would like any advice on safety please contact the sales team. We strongly believe in making business as straightforward as possible - you can order today and receive your delivery tomorrow. Order via the phone, email or the new website whichever is easiest for you. The offices are open 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday. If you would like someone from Funtime to visit you at your office, this can be arranged. Pleased to now announce that we are distributors for the humorous Spencer and Fleetwood range."

The business was was initially set up as a retirement project for Shashi. On Christmas Day in 2012, Sanjay and Shashi were chatting over the dinner table, and Shashi said she wanted to do something meaningful with her spare time. Sanjay suggested that she start selling traditional Indian Spice tins. Shashi grew up in India and has now lived in the UK for 49 years, but food and spice have always been a massive part of her upbringing and our family life. By learning the art of cooking with spice from her mum, aunties and sisters, she actually has over 60 years of cookery experience. It made sense for her to put all of this to use in her new project. So, on that infamous Christmas Day, the pair sat together and made a tin. Sanjay took a photo, listed it on eBay, and to their surprise, it sold on Boxing Day. Spice Kitchen was born. Fast-forward to the present day, Spice Kitchen has grown beyond their wildest imagination. Sanjay and Shashi carefully hand pick only the highest quality spices, manufacturing blends in- house to ensure freshness and flavour. Our signature products are an array of beautifully dressed sari wrapped spice tins, in honour of the sari Shashi wore when she first arrived in Birmingham in 1972. The sari wrapped spice tins are colourful and stand out on shelves for luxury gifting. Bestsellers are the award-winning Indian, Middle Eastern, Gin Botanical and World Spice Tins. "
