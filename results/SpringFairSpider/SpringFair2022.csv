Andrew says: “Our mission has always been to build long term relationships with customers and retain their loyalty by continuing to source and develop new products, whilst maintaining a core range of proven and trusted ranges. We work very closely with our ceramic suppliers in the heart of Andalusia, Spain, most being third generation family run businesses. This has allowed us to bring stunning hand painted ceramics for the home and garden to be enjoyed here in the UK.  We have also been able to create many bespoke ranges for customers who want something specific for their own customer base or to relate to their particular brand. We offer one of the most comprehensive ranges of Olive Wood in the UK. Our ethically sourced Tunisian Olive Wood is totally sustainable. Caring for, and protecting our environment is something we are passionate about here at DD. The birth of my beautiful grandchildren has reemphasised this passion and was part of my decision to have Recycled Glass as our launch product for 2019. The amount of energy to melt recycled glass is considerably less than that needed to melt raw materials which is used to make new bottles and jars.  Our range of both decorative homeware and contemporary tableware is one of our most proudly awaited launches. Soy Wax is our choice for our Home Fragrance Luxury candles.  Clean burning and releasing no harmful toxins they are again kinder to the environment and kinder to the home. Hand poured here in the UK these beautifully designed and gift boxed candles and diffusers bring stylish, beautiful and unique scents to the home. We also have a range of soy wax candles poured into re-usable ceramic and olive wood bowls. I am very lucky to be working with a very dedicated and loyal team here at Divine Distribution.  We are a “true” family and work together to make Divine Distribution the best it can be. A commitment to provide the very best in customer service is at the heart of the company.  We thank our existing customers for their support and loyalty and are always happy to welcome new trade customers. You can be assured of a friendly and professional response to all enquiries.”  Andrew"

It all started after graduating from university. I was suddenly on my own in the real world (scary) & it was time to create my own destiny. So after many (huge) slices of cake & cups of coffee it all began… CARDS TO KEEP. Throwing away greetings cards has always given me a headache. I'd often find myself piling up my birthday cards, putting them in a draw, only to stumble across them again & feel the same guilt about having to put the lovely messages people had sent me, in the bin! I'm slightly addicted to sweet food, & rather partial to a cocktail (or two), so that's where my idea came from… I don't profess to being an amazing baker, (however I have won a rosette for my chocolate brownies!), but I love sharing these easy recipes with my friends & family, & it's great to think that other people can now do the same with my greetings cards! This means the cards can be kept forever and reused... great for the environment.  I bake, style & photograph all of my cards, & of course enjoy the end product!"

The name? We had to incorporate our best (dog) friends somehow! Luna is Emma's little Dachshund and Charles is Laura's gigantic American Akita"

Costa Nova / Casafina continues to blaze a trail - fine stoneware from the best natural resources in Portugal.  The range is very on trend and celebrates all that is irresistibly Mediterranean: the love of enjoying life, family, friends and good food.  You can almost smell the soft sea air, olive trees and lemon verbena! The Gusta Kitchen collections include stylish cookware and a terrifically merchandisable barbecue accessories range - perfect for men's gifting. Gusta – celebrate the day.

Our backgrounds are a combination of retail, product development, marketing and creative design which resulted in us setting up as a Wholesale business. We found a group of incredibly talented artisans and makers who could turn our designs into actual products in good quantities, using the finest quality materials and not compromising on any attention to detail – we wanted our pieces to be beautiful, long lasting and well made products that would make sumptuous, original gifts that could be used again and again. Five years on and we are still as passionate about the yarn pom pom and our business as we were when the plan was hatching! Addictive little colourful balls that bring smiles and happiness to everyone who receives them. Our fabulous stockists many of whom are also small, boutique businesses specialising in super quality items, continue to support us simply because their customers just love pom poms too! When we began, there were no other pom pom products – we now have many competitors but are still confident that a PomPom Galore pom pom stands out from the crowd – again, and again! Enjoy!

Fresh out of the sea, salt in their hair, laughing, joking and totally carefree, they were having an absolute blast. That was the essence, right there, of Joe Browns - FUN, SPONTANEOUS AND FREE! Simon decided there and then that this remarkable spirit would make the foundations of a great brand. The mission? To make people feel great! Joe Browns have been creating remarkable clothing collections bursting with unique styles that customers want to wear time and time again since 1998. Bold colours, bright patterns, fabulous silhouettes and high quality, distinctive detailing make the collections unique and iconic… it would be a shame to stop at clothing wouldn’t it?! Our Homeware  In 2019 Joe Browns launched their first ever homeware collection, injecting the same spirit and passion possessed by their garments into each wonderfully unique homeware range, enabling customers to celebrate being a true individual. They take influence from all over the world, which is evident from their bold colour palettes to their exotic animal prints, meaning their customers are always guaranteed to find something a little different from the traditional high-street offerings. Every piece has a story to tell! It’s the small details and special finishing touches that make their collections stand out from the crowd and ensure your home - and now garden - is fabulously unique. Simon Brown, founder and managing director of Joe Browns, said: “We’ve approached homewares in the same creative way as we approach our clothing styles - developing wonderfully unique pieces that offer something a little different to the traditional offering. Our designers work incredibly hard to create remarkable pieces that add an individual touch to our customer’s homes - as we do their wardrobes.”"

Whilst planning their wedding, bride to be Georgina sought out to source bespoke candles for favours as well as to help create a scent to fill their rustic barn venue. Ever the crafter, Pinterest enthusiast and self confessed penny-pincher Georgina began her journey to creating her own candles bespoke to their big day. Presented in jam jars, made using her Granny's jam pot; decorated with twine and kraft labels, and scented with rhubarb and plums, the candles were enjoyed by the couple's family and friends throughout the day and the weeks that followed. After falliing in love with the candle making process the couple decided to put their new found skills to good use and Ivy & Twine was born. Each candle is still lovingly hand poured by Georgina, using only ethically sourced and sustainable ingredients. The process of preparing the candles in small batches ensures they are all finished to a high quality and standard. The 190g candles the company is most known for offer a 40 hour+ burn time and are highly fragranced offering a long lasting scent to fill any room. Each scent has been carefully chosen, tried and tested to ensure the best burn and fragrance throw. Rhubarb & Plum Noir was the very first of which and the scent the couple chose for their wedding candles. The range now extends to Wax Melts, Diffusers and Refills and Soaps and Lotions."

Supplying the Toy and Gift trade for over thirty years, Funtime Gifts helps recreate distant memories at the same time as inventing future ones. It's huge array of novelty gifts and toys provide something for everyone. Founder Malcolm Ford, first ventured into the puzzle and gift market while studying civil engineering at Loughborough University in 1969 and with two other engineers, formulated a range of complex 3D puzzles to test the brain, hand and eye coordination. These were launched for the first time in 1972 and led to the foundation of Funtime Gifts. Funtime is probably best revered for bringing the Disco Dancing Flowers and the singing fish â Big Mouth Billy Bass â to these shores. Nowadays in the world of iPhones and iPads, electronics and synchronisation in toys are taken totally for granted; twenty years ago it was unseen and was quite ground breaking. Today Funtime is still breaking the mould with guns that fire air, animals that laugh, lasers that turn your ceiling into a planetarium, the world's smallest Walkie Talkies and so much moreâ¦ Many items continue to stand the test of time, Pin Art and Newton's cradle on p43 and Spiral and Rainbow timers on p44 (and many more) have been in and out of the range for the last thirty years and will surely continue for many more to come. Somewhat unusually for the toy trade the catalogue runs from September each year, bringing you the latest in innovation and fun for Christmas that year, along with a major new product supplement in February. There are also regular newsletters and emails throughout the year. Many of the items in this catalogue cannot be found elsewhere. Along with making and packaging many of their own exclusive items such as the range of Impossipuzzles, Funtime also has exclusive distributorships with innovative manufacturers such as Can You Imagine, Gemmy and Westminster. The Hong Kong office was established twelve years ago to handle the FOB direct import business to customers around the world, and can also assist in sourcing product. The quality and compliance of any item supplied is of the utmost importance. All items conform to the appropriate standards and are packaged and labelled appropriately. If you would like any advice on safety please contact the sales team. We strongly believe in making business as straightforward as possible - you can order today and receive your delivery tomorrow. Order via the phone, email or the new website whichever is easiest for you. The offices are open 9am to 5pm Monday to Friday. If you would like someone from Funtime to visit you at your office, this can be arranged. Pleased to now announce that we are distributors for the humorous Spencer and Fleetwood range."

The business was was initially set up as a retirement project for Shashi. On Christmas Day in 2012, Sanjay and Shashi were chatting over the dinner table, and Shashi said she wanted to do something meaningful with her spare time. Sanjay suggested that she start selling traditional Indian Spice tins. Shashi grew up in India and has now lived in the UK for 49 years, but food and spice have always been a massive part of her upbringing and our family life. By learning the art of cooking with spice from her mum, aunties and sisters, she actually has over 60 years of cookery experience. It made sense for her to put all of this to use in her new project. So, on that infamous Christmas Day, the pair sat together and made a tin. Sanjay took a photo, listed it on eBay, and to their surprise, it sold on Boxing Day. Spice Kitchen was born. Fast-forward to the present day, Spice Kitchen has grown beyond their wildest imagination. Sanjay and Shashi carefully hand pick only the highest quality spices, manufacturing blends in- house to ensure freshness and flavour. Our signature products are an array of beautifully dressed sari wrapped spice tins, in honour of the sari Shashi wore when she first arrived in Birmingham in 1972. The sari wrapped spice tins are colourful and stand out on shelves for luxury gifting. Bestsellers are the award-winning Indian, Middle Eastern, Gin Botanical and World Spice Tins. "
