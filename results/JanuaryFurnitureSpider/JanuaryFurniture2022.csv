The journey started in 1945, when our Grandad returned home from WW2. He decided to take his furniture from the front room, put it in the shop window and start trading. We have come a long way since then – the business evolved into a wholesaler 25 years ago and it is currently being run by the 3rd generation of the Ellis family. Our love of travel and exploration took us to Indonesia 25 years ago. It was there that we started working with Indonesian artisan suppliers, eventually forming a network of trusted suppliers. We cherish these relationships; for us it is the true definition of fair trade and expressed in a discreet brass plaque on our furniture. Ethics Ancient Mariner has created many jobs for communities in Indonesia. Working closely with local craftsmen and women, our aim is to partner directly with the makers and support traditional ways of life. We are invested in helping to improve education standards and skills within the local villages we work with, as well as providing steady long-term employment for all of our employees. Sustainability As we continue to grow as a company, we are aware of the increasing strain on the environment caused by the depletion of natural resources such as forests and woodlands. With this in mind, we source all of our materials from government-sanctioned plantations, using only the highest quality recycled Mango, Mahogany and Teak. Keeping the Quality None of this commitment to tradition means we cut corners on quality and consistency. All our suppliers are overseen by highly skilled professionals ensuring the finish of our furniture is kept to the same high standard. We keep the village handmade production with the factory quality. Making unique furniture Like anything natural, Ancient Mariner Furniture has a distinctive character and this will only get better with age. Every piece has gone through a lengthy process in construction and is purposefully aged to give it even more character. We don’t try to hide irregularity in our furniture; in fact we think this gives each piece its distinctive character. Find us Our UK base is in the small village of Ribchester, nestled in the heart of the beautiful Ribble Valley. Here we have an extensive warehouse, as well as a newly-refurbished showroom with lifestyle room sets."

January Furniture Show,01/23/2022,2022,https://januaryfurnitureshow.com,DM,Alstons,1-C60,1-C60,www.alstons.co.uk,,,,"Colchester, United Kingdom",United Kingdom,,,,"The Alstons family were in the furniture trade for 150 years and were very proud of their heritage. Back in 1860, two brothers, William and Ambrose Alston, opened a furniture shop in Sudbury’s North Street instead of following the family line into the weaving trade. Master cabinet-makers by trade, the brothers’ shop quickly prospered, with loyal customers spreading the word about the brothers’ charming, well-made cabinets. Towards the end of the century they were able to move to Sudbury’s bustling Old Market Place, where they opened up a larger shop with cabinet and upholstery making workshops located behind. In 1950 Leslie decided to establish an upholstery manufacturing business on the back of success he had had with upholstery in their original Old Market Place workshop in Sudbury. The factory moved three times within Colchester before settling in Gosbecks Road. Over the next three decades the business expanded under Alan’s leadership. During that period it established itself as a major producer of well-engineered upholstery. The business grew steadily and by 1980 it was occupying a number of satellite factories in addition to its Colchester base which was run by the fifth generation of Alston brothers, John and David Alston. Today the business continues to thrive under the same values and ethos that the Alstons family created within the TCM Living portfolio. Their values are still the same as they always were: excellent quality, British-made products and steadfastly impeccable service."

Located close to the old Severn Bridge between Bristol and Newport. GFA operates from a stock warehouse with distribution facilities, offices and pre-packaged spare parts service. Backed by an experienced team of sales, service and account personnel, GFA is viewed by many retail clients, both multiple and Independents, as a top rate product source - both for pricing, quality and importantly, post sales service. GFA's product lines consist of Swivel Recliner Chairs, Riser Recliner Chair, Accent Chairs and UK made Fixed Sofa's. HISTORY & THE DIRECTORS The Executive Director, Tim Painter and the Managing Director, James Painter have a long and successful track record in the furniture industry, some 50 years between them. In 1979, Tim left hotel management when a client offered him a Directorship of a Christie Tyler manufacturing plant. This Group was making close to a third of all UK upholstery, and employed 8000+ people on 30 or more sites. In 1991, he left to set up his own Furniture agency working with top European sofa and chair manufacturers, bringing his younger brother James into the business a few years later. The Company went from strength to strength, particularly when it changed its sourcing focus from Europe to Asia almost 14 years ago. GFA has steadily built its reputation by concentrating on developing swivel motion chairs to suit all tastes and price targets. 2017 has been an exciting year for GFA with moving into a new building, expanding offices and spare parts warehouses! Many years on James is now sole owner of the company, with older brother Tim taking a step back from the helm. James heads product development, Far East liaison and sales, backed by a loyal team of sales agents covering all parts of the UK."
