Old World Christmas is the premier brand of Christmas ornaments in the country. The founders, Tim and Beth Merck, a couple who shared a special love for Christmas, are credited with revitalizing the art of mouth-blown fine glass ornaments as a result of their reintroducing figural designs to the United States in 1979.

Today, Old World Christmas offers the most extensive and best-loved collection with over 1,400 proprietary designs in styles ranging from traditional to whimsical. Our vast selection of finely crafted and affordable ornaments offers many choices to fit your personality or style. In addition we offer vintage style night lights.

Old World Christmas Creations

Each figural glass ornament produced by Old World Christmas is hand crafted in age-old tradition using the same techniques that originated in the 1800's. Molten glass is mouth-blown into finely carved molds made exclusively for Old World Christmas, before a hot solution of liquid silver is poured inside. The ornaments are then hand-painted and glittered in a series of labor-intensive steps to achieve the beautiful creations.

Our Commitment

At Old World Christmas our goal is simple: to offer the best in quality, design, and value. We promise to provide high-quality, traditionally designed, hand-crafted ornaments that are created with even more attention to detail than those produced 100 years ago. We are committed to excellent customer service, affordable prices, and fast, efficient shipping that is second-to-none."

An unattended candle sparked a fire that destroyed a neighbor's home, and he started looking for a solution. Inspired by a mug warmer he'd been given as a gift, He invested his family's savings into 5,000 mug warmers, and the original candle warmer was born. 

Our idea caught on quickly, and in 2007, Candle Warmers Etc. was selling a wide variety of candle warmers to over 10,000 gift shops across the US. The family business merged with 4 brothers-in-law to form the leadership group that carries the company today. Since the merger, Candle Warmers Etc. has continued to grow exponentially. Our current product line includes over 180 styles of fragrance warmers, across 10 unique product lines, and 176 wax products.

In 2016, we launched our new product line, Airomé, which features 100% pure essential oils, essential oil diffusers, and Himalayan salt lamps. Due to Airomé's overwhelming success, we continue to add new essential oils and aromatherapy products to our lineup to bring the best therapeutic-grade spa experience right into our customers' homes.

Candle Warmers Etc. continues to be the leader in the candle warming industry, while Airomé has been established as a source of high quality diffusers, therapeutic-grade essential oils, and decorative Himalayan salt lamps in the rapidly growing aromatherapy market. We remain committed to continuing in the company's tradition of family culture and constant innovation. Thank you for continuing to support us by being a part of the Candle Warmers Etc. family."

Koncept designers tossed away the traditional bulb-and-shade for a flexible, streamlined design incorporating LEDs. Since then, Kenneth and Edmund Ng have maintained the aesthetic simplicity of task and ambient lighting with a small footprint.

Koncept’s products have significantly influenced the LED task lighting design industry. Works have been featured in major press such as TIME Magazine, Oprah Magazine and numerous films and TV programs. Koncept has earned numerous international design awards including the Red Dot Design Award, iF Design Award and the Good Design Award.

An unattended candle sparked a fire that destroyed a neighbor's home, and he started looking for a solution. Inspired by a mug warmer he'd been given as a gift, He invested his family's savings into 5,000 mug warmers, and the original candle warmer was born. 

Our idea caught on quickly, and in 2007, Candle Warmers Etc. was selling a wide variety of candle warmers to over 10,000 gift shops across the US. The family business merged with 4 brothers-in-law to form the leadership group that carries the company today. Since the merger, Candle Warmers Etc. has continued to grow exponentially. Our current product line includes over 180 styles of fragrance warmers, across 10 unique product lines, and 176 wax products.

In 2016, we launched our new product line, Airomé, which features 100% pure essential oils, essential oil diffusers, and Himalayan salt lamps. Due to Airomé's overwhelming success, we continue to add new essential oils and aromatherapy products to our lineup to bring the best therapeutic-grade spa experience right into our customers' homes.

Candle Warmers Etc. continues to be the leader in the candle warming industry, while Airomé has been established as a source of high quality diffusers, therapeutic-grade essential oils, and decorative Himalayan salt lamps in the rapidly growing aromatherapy market. We remain committed to continuing in the company's tradition of family culture and constant innovation. Thank you for continuing to support us by being a part of the Candle Warmers Etc. family."

Oneonta,United States,"Body & Bath Products | Botanicals | Floral & Foliage | Fountains, Indoor | Holiday/Seasonal | Housewares | Jewelry, Vintage | Pottery & Ceramics | Vases | Wellness Accessories",,,"HOW WAS THE PRODUCT INSPIRED?

How do you integrate an eclectic background in Conceptual Art, Geology, Cooking, Gardening, and a little Chemistry thrown in for good measure?
SoapRocks, of course. It only took me 36 years and a shower one cold February morning with just soap scraps to use for washing. After a minute, I looked down at the object in my hand and saw a rock where pieces of soap used to be. There it began. Soap-Rock! SoapRocks! That light bulb moment and seven years of integrating herbs, oils, and wholesome ingredients changed the nature of bathing forever.

Here Are A Few Of My Thoughts About SoapRocks.
Soap reaches its consummation in SoapRocks® bath soaps. As a study in diminishing beauty, they bring wonder to daily life, transforming the most mundane of tasks into an inspiring daily reminder of nature's beauty. Unlike keepsakes, which are put up on a pedestal and soon forgotten, the beauty of each SoapRock is magnified in action! Under water, lighting up with brilliant natural color, their smooth stone-like texture will gently cleanse with a light lather, leaving your skin soft and refreshed. Discover the ever-changing contours of SoapRocks® bath soaps and let their beauty become you.

One Question We Often Get:
As beautiful as they are, how could you ever use them?
How could you not?

Each SoapRock® soap bar lights up under water, and over many uses, slowly weathers away in your hands like a stream stone in geologic time. SoapRocks® soap bars are endowed with extracts of earth: Aloe, Calendula, Chamomile, Comfrey, Lavender, Vitamin E, Jojoba Oil, Olive Oil, Almond Oil. Thus you can experience a beauty that penetrates, yet is skin deep. Prepare yourself for a consummate washing experience. They are a hybrid dense glycerine soap that lifts very little oil off of the skin as they gently cleanse. They are the art that touches us intimately, teaching us to appreciate beauty by using it, and letting it go.

What Becomes A Work Of Art? ..... You Do

A GLIMPSE INTO THE FUTURE
As our brand continues to grow, our goal remains the same as day one – to create gifts that will help you spread inspiration, kindness, joy and laughs.

NOT JUST ANOTHER BOOK
We wanted to make things differently than what we'd seen out there.  We started with our signature line of books using extremely thick paper and wire-o binding, so the books lay flat - with simple content and bold designs to engage readers.

The line now includes over 200 products – from magnets to stickers to lunch notes – all with the same quality and content in mind.

The Flensted Mobiles fairytale is actually based on two straws and three paper storks.

For this was what Christian Flensted cut out and assembled in 1953 when the christening of his daughter, Mette, was going to be celebrated. The result was the stork mobile, which was only conceived of as being a fun, ingenious and personal gift, but ended up as the prelude to Flensted Mobiles.

For only a year after the daughter’s christening the firm Flensted Mobiles was established.
And to this very day the stork mobile has remained in production.

When Christian Flensted founded the firm, along with his wife Grethe, the family was living in Aalborg – in the three-room flat where the workplace was the dining table and storage room was under the sofa.

Well-known ‘restless spirit’:
Christian Flensted became known as ‘Uromageren’, a Danish play on the word ‘Uro’, which means both ‘restless’ and ‘a mobile’ – i.e. both a maker of mobiles as well as someone whose mind is constantly in motion. This nickname corresponded well with his creative capacity to create elegant, classic designs – and unique, extraordinary mobiles that can both set their surroundings in motion and create a balance of mind. For when it comes to mobiles, rest and restlessness make a happy couple.

The baton passed on:
In 1982 Grethe and Christian Flensted decided to pass the baton on to Ole. In connection with this change of generation at Flensted Mobiles, the running of the company was now taken over by Ole and his wife, Aase. They have continued to operate the mobiles company every since, paying great respect to its ideals and creative angle on the world. The older generation gave room to the younger, so that they could leave their mark on the company – new mobiles came onto the drawing board, and new markets were opened up."

With the mission to reduce plastic waste by creating a practical and stylish alternative that can be taken anywhere you go, we launched our first product - Que collapsible water bottle. Since then, we’ve embedded our philosophy into all our makings - to sustainably create aesthetically pleasing everyday products.
Oh, and by the way, our name is pronounced “cue.”"

Our bold colour combinations, attention to detail in manufacturing and use of the finest soft nappa leathers has quickly built our reputation for quality and individual design."

It all started in a modest facility with two employees and a perfect velvet chair. Today, more than 45 years later, Vanguard Furniture is still making good on its name to be at the forefront of the furniture industry — from one perfect velvet chair to endless personalized possibilities. 

Vanguard Furniture, a family held company, employs over 600 associates and is currently operating out of six manufacturing buildings in Hickory, NC, a 40,000-square-foot showroom in High Point, NC, and a new manufacturing location in Hillsville, VA. Vanguard is a fashion-driven company with the goal of being the home furnishings leader in style, value and service while ultimately enriching lives through custom-crafted furniture. 

Known as a people-oriented company, Vanguard nurtures a strong family atmosphere from the manufacturing floor to the office and throughout the international sales force. For a number of years, Vanguard's associates have embraced the methodology of ""Lean Manufacturing"" — seeking continuous improvement in all departments (even eliminating waste that customers are unwilling to pay for). As a founding member of the Sustainable Furnishings Council, Vanguard's green initiatives include recycling 95% of all post manufacturing waste — recycling paper, fabric scraps, metal, wood scrap, plastic and corrugated products. Being sustainable is as a way of life at Vanguard."

In France in 1810, the Peugeot brothers converted their family’s gristmill into a steel foundry, producing a wide range of quality products from hand tools to automobiles. 
Peugeot created a burr style coffee grinder in 1840 and adapted the design to peppercorns in 1874.  This iconic pepper grinding mechanism, still used today in every Peugeot mill, represents the standard of category excellence: often imitated, but never equaled.  Products are still made in France.
