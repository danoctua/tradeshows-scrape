An unattended candle sparked a fire that destroyed a neighbor's home, and he started looking for a solution. Inspired by a mug warmer he'd been given as a gift, He invested his family's savings into 5,000 mug warmers, and the original candle warmer was born. Our idea caught on quickly, and in 2007, Candle Warmers Etc. was selling a wide variety of candle warmers to over 10,000 gift shops across the US. The family business merged with 4 brothers-in-law to form the leadership group that carries the company today. Since the merger, Candle Warmers Etc. has continued to grow exponentially. Our current product line includes over 180 styles of fragrance warmers, across 10 unique product lines, and 176 wax products.In 2016, we launched our new product line, Airomé, which features 100% pure essential oils, essential oil diffusers, and Himalayan salt lamps. Due to Airomé's overwhelming success, we continue to add new essential oils and aromatherapy products to our lineup to bring the best therapeutic-grade spa experience right into our customers' homes.Candle Warmers Etc. continues to be the leader in the candle warming industry, while Airomé has been established as a source of high quality diffusers, therapeutic-grade essential oils, and decorative Himalayan salt lamps in the rapidly growing aromatherapy market.

These ornaments, sculptures, signs, and home items show how up-cycled magazines can make a great focal point in your home or store. The sustainable nature of these products is unmatched as they are bringing items that would have ended up in a landfill, and giving them a new purpose. All of these products are handcrafted and will all be unique.

Within two years the company's main focus became Tiffany-styled lamps and shades, emphasizing high-quality reproductions of Louis Comfort Tiffany's designs. At the same time, Dale became the first factory worldwide to standardize stained-glass production and became a national resource for a product category that had been only regionally produced.Today, Dale Tiffany has become the world's foremost designer and manufacturer of fine art glass lighting and home accessories. Using only the highest quality genuine hand-rolled art glass, Dale offers an extensive range of designs utilizing the ""copper foil"" technique, an authentic glass assembly method originally developed by Louis Comfort Tiffany over 100 years ago. With this handcrafted process, no two pieces are exactly alike, making each design a treasured keepsake.Featuring stained glass, reverse-painted glass, hand-blown glass, and many other techniques, and inspired by the legendary designs of L.C. Tiffany, Philip J. Handel, Pairpoint, and others, Dale Tiffany has not only captured the timelessness of America's classic designers, but utilizes it's own creative skills to develop unique designs that blend perfectly with today's current home fashion trends and lifestyles.Whether producing expensive replicas or affordable budget-priced merchandise, Dale insists on the highest standards of quality and workmanship for every one of its products. Each glass shade is inspected on a light box to ensure brilliance of color, pattern, continuity and structural integrity. Each base is similarly inspected, having been manufactured in accordance with UL and CUL standards. All products are then assembled, tested, and packed, according to guidelines that meet or exceed industry standards, ensuring only the highest quality reaches the consumer's home.So, if your need is a table or floor lamp"
