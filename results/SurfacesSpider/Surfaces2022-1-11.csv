Empower your customers to maintain the proper humidity in their home to protect their investment in new hardwood flooring.  By educating your customers about humidity control, you make them part of the solution.  This professional approach allows customers to identify problems before they become costly headaches.  Include your company logo on the hygrometer, as well as on the professional-looking gift box so your customer is reminded of the great service you provided.

Why is a Thermo-Hygrometer Necessary?
Failure to keep Relative Humidity (RH) levels and Temperature in a proper range can damage hardwood flooring. High RH causes wood to expand which can result in cupping and even buckling in some situations.  Low RH causes the wood to contract which can cause excessive shrinking, cracking, and gaps between the wood.  

Any of these situations will result in customers that are disappointed with your flooring (whether it was your fault or not)!    These issues could have been prevented with an inexpensive Thermo-Hygrometer."

scheduling data to provide automated appointment reminders and accurate arrival times.

With PinPoint Status, you’ll save time and money by:

● Reducing call volumes. PinPoint Status can reduce the number of customer phone calls to one. After the first scheduling call is placed, all other communication between the field team and your customers can be managed through the app and text messages. There’s no need for reminder calls. You only need to call a customer if they want to reschedule an appointment.

● Eliminating missed appointments. When a customer isn’t home, appointments need to be rescheduled. Meanwhile, you’ve wasted valuable time that could have been spent on another job. With PinPoint Status, customers get an accurate estimate of your arrival time – and can notify you in advance if anything changes.

● Building customer loyalty. PinPoint Status enables you to transform your customer service experience using text message notifications, real-time GPS location data, and simplified two-way communication.

● Generating reviews and referrals. People readily give reviews on products and
services, and those reviews go a long way in building reputation and referral bases. You can set up PinPoint Status to automatically ask customers for an online review after the job is done. That means you can capture positive reviews immediately and tie those reviews to Google and social media platforms."

Diatex began its activity in 1996, through the contribution of its members, who were working since many years in the production of diamond tools. The company was born with the aim of producing the best tools for the customer requirements, by developing in the ceramic field, high performances tools to allow not only meeting the requirements, but also being competitive on the market.

Diatex grows in a short time, enhances the number of employees and in 2006 moves to the current headquarter, located in Via Firenze, Villaverla, where it is nowadays producing its diamond tools, and where it designs, on their own R&D department, products intended to work new materials.
The company has always headed to a constant research of new solutions for customers needs, making the “customer oriented” a policy of primary importance for the business development and for the relationship with the market.

To this day we are present in the USA with our branch in Clarksville (TN) and in Castellon (Valencia-Spain)."

CTEF launched the Certified Tile Installer (CTI) certification program in 2008 to provide a means for good, knowledgeable tile installers to verify their skills and promote themselves to potential clients and employers. At the same time, the certification program addresses a significant opportunity in the marketplace to provide consumers and specifiers with a mechanism for identifying the level of proficiency of prospective tile installers and encourages them to use only the best-qualified installers, ensuring that their tile project is installed correctly from the beginning, and looks beautiful for years to come.

The CTI Test is a comprehensive evaluation of the skills and knowledge of experienced tile installers which includes a multiple-choice exam and a hands-on test. Both are based on current industry standards and best practices for producing a sound installation that exhibits good workmanship. The tests, therefore, require that both the observable and non-observable characteristics of a finished installation are executed properly.

To offer consumers greater confidence that their tile installers follow tile installation procedures that exceed ANSI standards and TCNA guidelines for floor and wall, six leading tile industry organizations came together to create the Advanced Certifications for Tile Installers (ACT) program:

The Ceramic Tile Education Foundation,
The International Masonry Institute,
The International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers,
The National Tile Contractors Association,
The Tile Contractors' Association of America, and
The Tile Council of North America.

ACT tests evaluates the skills and knowledge of tile installers and currently offers certifications in nine specific areas of tile installation.  An installer may choose to become ACT certified in one or more of these areas:

Advanced Tile Installation Certifications (ACT) hands-on modules:
Grouts,
Large Format Tile & Substrate Preparation,
Membranes,
Mortar Floors,
Mortar Walls,
Three Shower Receptors Methods, and
Gauged Porcelain Tile and Gauged Porcelain Tile Panels/Slabs.
 
ACT certification in each area is granted upon successful completion of a written online test - designed to measure the installer's understanding of applicable ANSI specifications and TCNA recommended methods - and a field test conducted by trained, third-party evaluators who assess the installer's skills under real-life conditions.

CTEF offers on-site training modules that can be presented at your facility. CTEF can work with you to select and develop the best curriculum to meet your needs and offers basic to advanced, on-site training modules for manufacturers, contractors, distributors and other interested groups.
Both short- and long-term programs can be tailored to building contractors, inspectors, counter or sales people, remodelers, installers, and other groups.
Training sessions can be introductory, basic, advanced, or refresher depending on the needs of the group.
Companies may also schedule private training sessions at the CTEF facility in Pendleton, SC."

Since then, their passion has multiplied.

With sweat equity and the conviction to literally ‘bet the farm’ for BUECHEL STONE’s future, growth was pivotal. Ma and Pa Buechel were determined. They achieved progress through the grit of trial and error. As a company, we’ve experienced our share of setbacks and mistakes. But hey, that’s all part of our journey.

We got some things right. In fact, BUECHEL STONE pioneered some pretty incredible innovations – built on the simple VISION of becoming your first choice because of our unparalleled service and exceptional selection of natural stone. Somehow along the way, everyone became part of something bigger – not to be measured in increments of tons or square feet. Instead, we live by a greater MISSION: providing the best, most dependable experience in the natural stone industry – guaranteed!

With every stone installed, not only are we literally giving you a piece of our company; everyone who touches that stone is investing a part of their lives into your project.

The hands that ruffle the hair of a beloved grandson, or gripped a golf driver in college, or salute a commanding officer are the same hands that work together to provide unique, best experiences to all of you.

So we started sharing our teammates’ journeys and successes, putting it in the context of proudly referring to them as the #Rockstars that they are. 

Buechel Stone’s mission of “providing the best, most dependable experience in the natural stone industry – GUARANTEED!” guides us in every decision we make, including how we treat our colleagues. We’ve started showing how grateful and appreciative we are in the last few years by initiating an Extreme Anniversary Program to recognize and reward years of tenure with cash, trips, and more extravagant gifts as more years of service are celebrated.

Our stories define and inspire us. They create the truths we carry with us into the future. That’s why recognizing and providing best experiences is so important to us – so you can have your own future filled with success stories."
