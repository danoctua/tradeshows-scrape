Empower your customers to maintain the proper humidity in their home to protect their investment in new hardwood flooring.  By educating your customers about humidity control, you make them part of the solution.  This professional approach allows customers to identify problems before they become costly headaches.  Include your company logo on the hygrometer, as well as on the professional-looking gift box so your customer is reminded of the great service you provided.

Why is a Thermo-Hygrometer Necessary?
Failure to keep Relative Humidity (RH) levels and Temperature in a proper range can damage hardwood flooring. High RH causes wood to expand which can result in cupping and even buckling in some situations.  Low RH causes the wood to contract which can cause excessive shrinking, cracking, and gaps between the wood.  

Any of these situations will result in customers that are disappointed with your flooring (whether it was your fault or not)!    These issues could have been prevented with an inexpensive Thermo-Hygrometer."

scheduling data to provide automated appointment reminders and accurate arrival times.

With PinPoint Status, you’ll save time and money by:

● Reducing call volumes. PinPoint Status can reduce the number of customer phone calls to one. After the first scheduling call is placed, all other communication between the field team and your customers can be managed through the app and text messages. There’s no need for reminder calls. You only need to call a customer if they want to reschedule an appointment.

● Eliminating missed appointments. When a customer isn’t home, appointments need to be rescheduled. Meanwhile, you’ve wasted valuable time that could have been spent on another job. With PinPoint Status, customers get an accurate estimate of your arrival time – and can notify you in advance if anything changes.

● Building customer loyalty. PinPoint Status enables you to transform your customer service experience using text message notifications, real-time GPS location data, and simplified two-way communication.

● Generating reviews and referrals. People readily give reviews on products and
services, and those reviews go a long way in building reputation and referral bases. You can set up PinPoint Status to automatically ask customers for an online review after the job is done. That means you can capture positive reviews immediately and tie those reviews to Google and social media platforms."

The current membership exceeds 2,000 members in over 50 countries. The association offers a wide array of technical and training resources, professional development opportunities, regulatory advocacy, and networking events. Two prominent publications—the Dimension Stone Design Manual and Building Stone Magazine—raise awareness within the natural stone industry and in the design community for best practices and uses of natural stone.

The association serves as the authoritative source for safety and technical standards and information regarding the use of natural stone. It operates an industry accreditation program and two prestigious awards programs, as well as a continuing education program for architects and designers.

The Natural Stone Institute was formed in 2018 as a merger of the Marble Institute of America and the Building Stone Institute.  The Building Stone Institute was formed in 1894 as the International Cut Stone Contractors and Quarrymen’s Association; the name was changed to the Building Stone Institute in 1955. Established in 1903 as the National Association of Marble Dealers, the Marble Institute of America officially formed in 1944, when the association merged with the National Association of Marble Producers. In 1962, the National Association of Marble Builders merged with MIA. In 2021, the National Building Granite Quarriers Association (NBGQA) merged with the Natural Stone Institute. The NBGQA was founded in 1916."
