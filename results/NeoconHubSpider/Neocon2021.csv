Founded in 2016, the technology company is now a provider of smart and space-saving locker solutions for healthcare and manufacturing locker rooms for employees. The solution offers maximum space efficiency with the best possible employee comfort. The company currently employs around 32 people in Switzerland and the EU.

Development, marketing and sales, as well as administrative activities are coordinated at the headquarters in Switzerland. Production is carried out by a number of production partners, while final assembly takes place at the company's own assembly site in Hungary. Close cooperation with specialists such as Dormakaba, Salto, Helbling and BURRI Public Elements allows for short development cycles, while working with the latest technologies and the highest quality standards.

With its smart soft locker solutions, Zippsafe sets new standards in locker rooms for employees and achieves space savings of up to 70% compared to conventional locker systems. Thus, in times of urbanization and digitalization, Zippsafe enables the transformation towards space-saving and smart locker room solutions for employees while offering the best possible user-friendliness.

 

The product innovation

Zippsafe reinvents the locker by replacing the traditionally used hard materials such as metal or wood with a smart textile. The usually solid locker thus becomes a flexible locker solution, also called smart soft locker solution. The core of the Zippsafe solution is formed by the textile locker bags, which flexibly adapt in size to the items stored. This novel concept of stowage requires only 30 percent of the space compared to a classic locker. More space-efficient than any other wardrobe solution, Zippsafe thus often saves hundreds of valuable square meters.

The user-friendliness of the system was central from the very beginning. Clothes can be conveniently hung up via a pull-out hanger. Despite the high space efficiency, smaller items can be stored in the inside pockets and larger items such as handbags or motorcycle helmets on the bottom of the locker bag. Another focus has been placed on hygiene. Integrated ventilation and antimicrobial fabric improve locker room hygiene and reduce the risk of contamination of fresh workwear. In addition, the Zippsafe solution is also RFID compatible and can be managed online. Overall, in addition to space efficiency, user-friendliness, hygiene and digital management of the employee locker rooms can be optimized.

Zippsafe has been awarded ""Best Business Idea"" by ""The Entrepreneurial Wave"" in 2016, receiving the Venture Kick Award in 2017 and being a finalist at the SEF Awards 2020, the company has won orders from an international clientele from Switzerland, Germany, Austria, France, Belgium, Latvia and the USA."

This includes introducing textiles made from natural and sustainable materials, or British wool sourced right in our backyards, and also making recycled polyesters from post-consumer recycled plastic bottles.

MIF is committed to a philosophy of sustainability as well as an &ldquo;earth to table&rdquo; approach with each piece of solid wood furniture born in our mills. We strive to avoid wasteful production practices and never incorporate materials that will needlessly bloat landfills or end up in the trash.Built in 2018 by Susan Pilato, the MIF origins trace back several decades to the founder&rsquo;s father, who passed down a simple code to live by. These 8 &ldquo;mantras&rdquo;:&nbsp; 1. Get it done. 2. Say something nice to everyone you meet. 3. Be cheerful &amp; optimistic. 4. Show enthusiasm. 5. Show organization &amp; appearance. 6. Moderation. 7. Drive carefully. 8. Keep on trying.The MIF portfolio currently includes the following collections, each with a namesake that provides individual personality all while adhering to the core values of the brand: The Clayborne, The Ellis, and Lowe Loop. Each collection is as unique and distinct as its namesake while still upholding the standards of high quality and performance as evidenced through the design.
The Clayborne Collection: Named after the code&rsquo;s author, solid strength of character embodies this collection from its dovetail joint details to its steel leg frame foundation. As was with its namesake, the gentleman&rsquo;s quality of being well dressed is inherent throughout its design.
The Ellis Collection: Striking the right balance, Ellis conveys confidence through the firm handshake of wood matched with the decisiveness of steel. It leaves an authoritative impression while maintaining an open and approachable personality.
The Lowe Loop Collection: Our Lowe Loop Collection personifies the contrast of strength and softness. The subtle detail of a routed edge meshed with the cleanliness of a precise steel edge expresses the quality of a deep embrace between two opposites.
From professional environments to hospitality spaces and anywhere the end user seeks a closer connection to the earth, MIF is proud to collaborate with the design community to offer an alternative for those seeking an elevation of American craftsmanship.&nbsp; By designers, for designers, we are Mantra Inspired Furniture.

Norma Summerville started and led the store in an era when it was uncommon for women to run businesses. Summervilles’ flourished under Norma’s leadership until 1987. When her son, John ‘Skip’ Summerville, took over, it didn't stop there. Now, the father-son duo of Skip and Aaron Summerville use combined leadership to helm the RGS ship.

Hailing from “The City of Invention,” RGS is no stranger to new ideas. As Summervilles’, it was the first to offer on-site store parking in downtown Akron. And it built the first office furniture indoor showroom.

Today, RGS holds several design and utility patents. One such design is a true modular conference table with interchangeable parts. This allows the table to expand and contract to any desired length. Another is a lounge chair with removable and reversible tablet arm. And the innovation doesn't stop there.

RGS produces a wide array of furniture, with a focus is in Training Room, Breakroom, Conference, Case Goods, and Seating. For your Training Room needs, select from the most sturdy, stylish, and functional table bases. And with our Conferencing tables, you won't only find stylish tops and beautiful finished. You'll also find hardware that allows you to have an efficient meeting.

In-stock products are ready to ship out of Akron, Ohio the same or next day. Even custom items built to your specifications on-site have a quick turnaround time.

At RGS, you’ll get the honest and helpful customer service you’d expect from a small business. We treat our customers like family. We treat each caller with the respect they deserve. We're all dedicated to professional problem solving and cordial answers to your questions."

Ours is not a flashy approach, rather, we are driven by a deep passion based on helping people communicate effectively, because we believe in the power of the written word.

Claridge was there after World War II, helping schools and businesses get a fresh start. Our boards were there during the space race, helping brainstorm how to land a man on the moon.
