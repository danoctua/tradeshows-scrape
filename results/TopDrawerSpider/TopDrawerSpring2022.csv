Our mission is to make a small but positive difference in a kind and thoughtful way, both through the products we sell and the way we operate. The materials, community and process behind our products are just as important as the final plastic-free product. We started making beeswax wraps in our kitchens in early 2017 in a bid to cut as much plastic as possible from our lives. A few ruined irons and a lot of perfecting our secret wax blend later, and we’ve created a product (and a brilliant little company!) that we are incredibly proud of. We are an independent and female-led company, and would not be where we are today without the wonderfully powerful team of people who make and shape our business. We are more than just a company with owners and employees, we are a community, we are all collaborators, and we are committed. Alongside our award-winning wraps, we also offer a collection of simple plastic-free creations including kits and bundles, rewax bars and more. Our mission is this: Simple creations to help you waste less. "
