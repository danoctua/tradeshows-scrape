We strongly believe that spending quality time with kids is extremely important for their future development, self-confidence and creating long-lasting connections with others. Our purpose is to enrich this special bond, as well as inspire and excite through educational play. Because we all deserve beautiful memories, meaningful relationships and the space for balanced personal growth.  

All our product ideas are born in a family-run studio, where a team of illustrators, designers, project managers, as well as educators work together to transform original concepts into innovative and inspiring products. We share our passion, creativity and knowledge so that Banana Panda’s educational cards, books and sets of puzzles help the youngest and their caregivers explore the world, develop their imagination, and above all – enjoy play like never before! 

Great graphic design and quality really matter to us because we believe they really matter to our customers. We want our products to be appealing to little ones with beautiful, funny illustrations and fresh, contemporary aesthetics. We always use the best, safe, top-quality materials and we double-check every element of our products before they are shipped to stores. 

We truly believe that exploring the world together with a baby as early as possible will give them the best start in life, and that’s why our toys are designed to stimulate babies’ brains from their very first days. Banana Panda supports the development of a child in many aspects, including emotional, social, motor, intellectual, and creative spheres.

We are more than happy that our toys can help parents and kids to learn about the world together, inspire each other and bring so much fun! We truly value long-term relationships with our little and adult customers. 

We love what we do."

The fabrics are made to be educational with images made of shapes, letters and numbers - creating a look and find design appealing to kids.  These fabrics are created by mom inventor Kelley Legler and her two kids Jack and Bailey, by turning their crayon drawings into fabric textiles.  

Baby Jack is known for being the only children’s brand with tag toys having ribbons sewn shut for added safety, after seeing her son get his finger intertwined in a looped ribbon tag blanket. This is an added safety feature keeping kids’ fingers, toes and even tongue ties safe from getting caught.  These Baby Jack sewn shut ribbon tags still provide sensory play and stimulation which helps the development of kids’ sense of touch, taste, smell, sight and sound.  Sensory play is essential for growth, meeting milestones and children grow cognitively, socially and emotionally with developmental toys that Baby Jack & Co. sells.

Recently, owner Kelley Legler debuted The Learning Lovey Travel Collection featuring top city landscapes and state fabric designs that educate kids about state capitals, birds, trees, etc. and encourage a love for travel."

We supply our own brands and products to a broad range of customers from independent and multinational retailers to distributors. We also design, develop and manufacture OEM products for other brand owners.

Our portfolio boasts of more than 4,000 products, distributed in over 40 countries around the globe. It is that breadth of business, as well as continual investment which has enabled us to trade well throughout these current challenging and volatile times. We pride ourselves on being highly flexible and able to adapt quickly, focussing on continuous improvement and sustainability.
Product of course plays a significant role in the success of our business and many of our product range promote active play for all the family. Brands such as Xootz, a leading wheeled toy brand, or PlayHouse, an outdoor creative play brand, will encourage children and families to go out exploring and have fun. 
The entire Xootz range delivers the full package with superb specification and features, competitive pricing and multiple Toy awards. 
Playhouse, our range of garden play furniture, provides hours of exciting fun for all kids. The addition of Water Wall to the range teaches kids about gravity, angles and water flow. Water Wall is packed with limitless combinations, for children to enjoy a different creation every time they move the pieces. With a multitude of modular accessories included, kids can have fun creating their own water flows and seeing their problem-solving skills come to life as they pour water from the top.

Other brands such as Mi-Mic, combine innovation, technology and hot trends, allow children to become a pop star in their own home. With Mi-Mic kids can play your favourite songs directly from a mobile and sing along over the top, thanks to the Bluetooth microphone speaker.

Whilst product development is at the heart of what we do, we rely on a team of over 200 talented people in the UK, Hong Kong and the USA to make all this happen. 

The last 12 months have also seen significant investments in the US, such as the opening of a new fulfilment facility in Los Angeles to service our partners with some other leading brands - Osprey, one of Europe’s main contenders in action sports on both land and sea, offering rugged, affordable products that are perfect for thrill-seekers of all abilities, and Volkswagen Leisure, featuring the iconic VW campervan in a fun product range.

With such a wide range of product offer as well as a professional, engaging team to work with, Wilton Bradley is a perfect partner."

At its inception, Swimline was the largest manufacturer of above-ground pool liners, covers, and all related accessories.

In 1990, Swimline founded International Leisure Products, which expanded the product line to pool toys, games, fun floats and accessories. With this vast array of pool products, Swimline continued to deliver on the needs of its reputable business partners to provide quality products.

Four years later, in 1994, Swimline acquired United Leisure Industries HydroTools Inc., which allowed the company to manufacture traditional pool accessories such as leaf skimmers, pool filters, and a wide range of maintenance equipment to keep pools in top shape. HydroTools furthers our commitment to supplying quality products to the pool trade.

To capture the full spectrum of the industry, Swimline dove into the water sports market in 2007 with its new emerging brand Solstice. Continuing to tap into this sporting goods market, Solstice expanded in 2009 to include boats, kayaks, and inflatable stand up paddle boards.

Products are designed to develop technical thinking and spatial intelligence, as well as to derive inspiration and have fun.
Love and exploration in everyday life is the source of the inspiration for us
We created a collection of models of different themes that allows to explore various fields of mankind activety:
Space, Aircrafts, Ships, Transportation, Industrial, Architecture, Arts, Sport and more.
Our spectacular models are made of 304 stainless steel. 
This grade of steel is the safest and most commonly used in the food industry.
high-end steel sheets, axises, specific spirals, corner beams, gears etc.
High power laser cutting and nibbling technology is used at production lines. 
A  focused laser beam provides a high concentration of energy and allows you to cut out a part of the dense parts of the constructor.
Etching selectivity is based on the difference in the rates of the chemical reaction in different parts of the etched surface.
Resulting etch pits can be assessed both qualitatively and quantitatively using a conventional optical microscope.
During production, we adhere to all major safety and environmental standards.
We design and manufacture our products so they’re safe for their intended use.
Protecting the environment is a core element of our corporate strategy.
Our sustainability strategy extends well beyond the manufacturing of our products and is also applied to upstream and downstream processes. 
This begins with the purchase of environmentally-friendly materials and ends with efficient logistics, avoiding empty runs and ensuring optimum use of freight capacity.
Each kit is used on a DIY basis.
The system consists of high-quality metal details, angle girders, wheels, gears, bolts, axises and sheets.
Instead of screwdrivers, glue or soldering we use only pliers in the assembling process.

Our dolls delight children, collectors, and people of all ages, everywhere. Madame Alexander dolls are renowned for quality, innovation, and play value, and have found a special place in American families for generations.  They are sure to find a special place in yours!

Madame Alexander initiated a series of firsts in the toy industry: 
• The first doll based on a licensed character (Alice in Wonderland), which led to the creation of dolls based on characters from popular motion pictures.
• Madame Alexander was first to create dolls in honor of living people (Queen Elizabeth, the First Ladies, the Dionne Quints).
• The first to bring feature baby dolls to market.
• Madame Alexander popularized “sleep eyes” (the innovation that allows a doll to close its eyes when its head is tilted back) in the late ‘30s.
• Madame Alexander introduced the first American fashion doll (Cissy) with haute couture outfits.
Madame was also a pioneering female business owner and a strong role model for modern girls. 

Madame Alexander dolls have been a coveted collectible for 99 years, engaging all kinds of doll lovers. Some Madame Alexander lovers collect Wendy and others collect baby dolls, but one thing unites all collections: they all start with a first doll! With that first doll, we hope to guide our customers down the “Path to Passion,” inspiring years of collecting that’s fun at any age.  

Whether the doll is a classic baby, a literary character, or updated play doll, we strive to provide dolls that drive imaginative play for children, provide pleasure to the collector and welcome all into the world of our exquisite collectible dolls.

There are so many exciting developments to share, be sure you visit our Toy Fair booth to hear all about it, meet our team and see our new family of beautiful dolls!"

At HABA USA everything we do is based on child growth, development, and happiness. We believe that children are more important than anything else, so everything we create is designed to make a child’s eyes light up and help them have fun while learning and growing.

But that doesn’t mean we ignore adults. HABA USA emphasizes social responsibility and environmental sustainability. The toys we sell are designed to last for years, keeping trash out of landfills, and are made from wood that is sustainably sourced. And we know that our employees and partners are among our greatest resources. We aim for success and fairness in everything we do.

We are known most for our wooden toys and game bits that are still produced primarily in Germany.  Our raw timbers are sourced locally and come from PEFC  certified forests.  Wooden clutching toys, blocks and game bits are given a beautiful shiny color and protective coating from 100% safe, non-toxic stains to allow the woodgrains to shine through.   And when we don't use wood as the core source in the toys we are using only the highest quality fabrics, silicone etc.

At HABA we believe in allowing the child's imagination and creativity grow while playing with our toys.  If you want a toy where the child presses a button and voila - we're not it.  A child is going to engage their emotional, physical and intellectual skills when playing with our toys - and more often than not their social skills as well!"

Carpenter Avenue",United States of America,,,,"Family-owned and operated for nearly 50 years, Elenco provides educational/STEM products, including the popular Snap Circuits® circuit-building toys and Teach Tech® robotic kits. Located in the Chicago suburb of Wheeling, Illinois, Elenco has been family owned and operated since 1972. Gil Cecchin, one of Elenco’s founders, was an electrical engineer who believed the best way for kids to learn is by doing. All Elenco products follow this Learn By Doing® philosophy.

For nearly 20 years, Snap Circuits® has been the go-to toy for teaching electronics, engineering and more. The award-winning Snap Circuits® brand has been endorsed by K-12 educators globally and used in schools, libraries, museums, after-school and homeschool programs, STEM and Maker programs, and at home. Many of today’s rising leaders in science and technology learned the basics of engineering by creating and inventing with Snap Circuits® as a child. 

Snap Circuits® teaches basic electronics concepts by using building components with snaps to assemble electronic circuits on a simple base grid. Each Snap Circuits® part is easily identifiable by a different color and function, and each kit comes with an easy-to-use, full-color manual and online links for creating hundreds of exciting projects. The line offers a wide range of kits in differing size, theme, and complexity. Kits can be combined to make larger projects and kids can create their own circuits.  In 2020, Snap Circuits® launched a coding line and  also expanded its fanbase with MyHome, designed to make electricity relevant and engaging to kids of all backgrounds. 

Teach Tech® features build-it-yourself robotic kits that explore mechanical engineering, renewable energy, and coding. Products in this line appeal to anyone who enjoys using their hands to build, tinker, and bring their creations to life with movement, coding, and programming. Forward-thinking kids can explore alternative energy with kits that highlight solar, hydraulic, or wind power.

Showing Elenco’s commitment to STEM, Snap Circuits® has earned many significant industry awards, including TIA’s Specialty Toy of the Year, ASTRA’s Best Toys for Kids (for seven consecutive years), the KAPi Award for “Best Educational Product” and “Pioneer Team”, the first-ever “Seriously STEM” Award in 2018 and again in 2019 for Engineering, and much more.  Snap Circuits® and Teach Tech® products have received the “Stem Approved” Trustmark from STEM.org.

Elenco’s WEmake® line includes educational, DIY-kits and tools that teach soldering and basic electronics. Elenco is also the North American partner for world-renowned brands Engino Construction, Edu-Toys® Science Kits, and Smartivity® Labs. 

Smartivity® built-it-yourself STEAM activity kits are made from high-quality, re-engineered, laser-cut wood. 
All Smartivity® products are recyclable, safe, non-toxic, and sustainable. All kits offer mess-free assembly using rubber bands - no glue or batteries required. Projects can be decorated with art materials from home. Designed for learning fundamental principles of STEM/STEAM, each kit comes with easy-to-understand, illustrated instructions with experiments to ensure understanding of concepts learned through play.

Elenco’s mission is to provide quality, innovative toys and educational products that are fun, affordable, engaging, and designed to instill a passion for learning and creating."
